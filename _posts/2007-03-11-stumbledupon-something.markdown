Bored as always, I went to LiveABigLife.com to see what had been going on since I last visited the page. Yes, the guy is Christian and can sometimes get caught up with Jesus, God and the rest of them, but he still writes beautifully compiled blog posts about subjects that I find somewhat interesting.

This time he led me to StumbleUpon, an internet service that lets you stumble upon websites within the limits of your interests. I thought I'd give it a try, not expecting a lot.

The whole idea is simply that you download an extension to Firefox, <em>which is a less good browser than Opera</em>, that enables you to simply press a button and immediately be taken to a random website. It actually surprised me, as 90% of the websites it takes me to in fact are enjoyable.

The first few links were to some nonsense flash tools that entertained me for a while, followed by an interesting and enjoyable blog post about web design. I'm clearly less bored than 10 minutes ago!

If you too are bored this hot and sunny Sunday afternoon, I urge you to give it a try.
