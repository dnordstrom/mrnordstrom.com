About three years ago, an application called Siri went into the final stages of testing at a company with the same name: Siri, Inc. It was a seemingly simple personal assistant created for the iPhone and planned for other smartphones. As they submitted Siri to the App Store, little did its inventors know about the impact it would eventually have on smartphone technology.

Back then, voice recognition was dominated by applications such as today's Dragon Dictate. These were large, complex applications for voice commands. They weren't particularly smart, and they definitely weren't anything you would slap on a smartphone just for the fun of it. Suddenly arrived this new, virtually unknown kid on the block; at half the size and claiming to have twice the brains.

The claims must have been true, because the application caught the attention of Apple, who ended up acquiring Siri, Inc. shortly after the release. As they say, the rest is history.

When iOS 6 was released, some people were glad that Siri would be available on the iPad. Others, like myself, remained disappointed that Siri was still unavailable for the iPod. The bad news is that this is still the case; the good news is that it doesn't have to be.

Brilliant software, despite being useful to anyone, isn't always available to everyone. It can't be; such is reality. However, I'm a firm believer that when it easily can be, then it most often should be.

Therefore, a second story will now be told: the story of how an impatient and stubborn believer may enable Siri on her iPod Touch 4G. Fortunately, it's a short and simple story.

# How To Install Siri on an iPod

<ol>
<li><p>Jailbreak your iPod using <a href="http://www.redsn0w.us" title="Redsn0w">Redsn0w</a>, following the simple instructions provided in the app. More extensive guides <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=redsn0w+guide&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" title="Redsn0w Jailbreak Guides">can be found</a>.</p><p>Remember to use Redsn0w to boot the iPod when you want access to jailbreak applications such as Cydia.

That's all. While it may not work as flawlessly as the original Siri on a late model iPhone, it's still Siri and it's now on your iPod. Have fun with your new friend!
