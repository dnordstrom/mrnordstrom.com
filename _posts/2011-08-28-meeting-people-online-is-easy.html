<p>The internet has completely changed how many of us meet people. It used to be a matter of a real-life get-together kinda thing, and now it can be a matter of replying to someones blog post or tweet. That changes things substantially but does it really make it all any simpler?</p>

<p>At a first glance at the subject, it seems so. It&rsquo;s faster and easier to &ldquo;meet&rdquo; and become &ldquo;friends&rdquo; with someone you&rsquo;re in contact with over the internet, whether it&rsquo;s via Facebook, Twitter, Skype or whatever&mdash;pick your poison. But do you really, I mean really, get a complete sense of who that person is until you&rsquo;ve met him or her in person or talked over the phone?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. And that&rsquo;s where it gets complicated for people like myself who practically hate phones and everything resembling them. Why? Fuck knows. I suppose it&rsquo;s a feeling of insecurity mixed with control-freakiness.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t know how the person on the other end sounds. If you&rsquo;re using a webcam, you don&rsquo;t know how they dress until the moment is right there. You thought you knew it all, and suddenly you don&rsquo;t know shit, and it&rsquo;s frightening to some people. Now, is this where I&rsquo;m supposed to come in and comfort those people and tuck them in?</p>

<p>Fuck that. I used to be, and part of me still am, one of those people that for some stupid-ass reason are nervous about something as natural as human contact, and I say &ldquo;fuck it, just do it&rdquo;. I know the last part is trademarked by Nike but I&rsquo;ve said it so many times it should be trademarked to me by now. Just. Fucking. Do. It. Why? Do you really need me to spell that shit out for you?</p>

<p>OK, then. If you don&rsquo;t take it from chatting to the phone or webcam, you&rsquo;ll be stuck without progress when it comes to knowing the person. At some point, you&rsquo;re gonna need to take it a step further. And what have you really got to lose? I mean, what&rsquo;s the worst shit that could happen? Rejection? Maybe&mdash;but rejection is something you&rsquo;ve gotta learn how to deal with in life, otherwise you&rsquo;ll get nowhere, and get nothing or no one.</p>

<p>Truth is also that the person on the other end may be just as frightened as you are, if not more so. Who knows? So just take the fucking chance and do it, OK? Take my word on it; it&rsquo;s not something you&rsquo;re likely to regret. I met my first fianc&eacute;e through the web and I don&rsquo;t regret meeting her in person&mdash;it was fucking amazing, a magic moment never to be forgotten. An angel had fallen from the web and landed right in my lap (literally).</p>

<p>Besides, I&rsquo;ve always lived by the motto that I&rsquo;d rather regret something I&rsquo;ve done than something I haven&rsquo;t done. Isn&rsquo;t that a much more fun way to live than ending up 90 years old and regretting the million chances you never took? That&rsquo;s what I thought. So fuck it, just do it.</p>

<p>As the amazing role-model I am, I&rsquo;ve taken the first step and set up a Skype date with sweet young Ally on Sunday. It&rsquo;ll be out of this world, I&rsquo;m sure of it.</p>
