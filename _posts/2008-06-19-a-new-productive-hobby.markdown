If you read the <a href="http://www.appleare.com/2008/06/18/first-impressions-of-podcasts-in-contrast">Apple blog</a>, then you may have read that I just yesterday dusted off my iPod after months of inactivity. A strange thing is that I didn't at all feel like listening to music while only a few month ago, I did it every day.

I've asked myself why music doesn't appeal to me anymore except for when I'm at home with my speakers. My thoughts are that, for good or bad, it affects you emotionally and has an impact on your mood but it's just not very <em>productive</em>.

So I got this brilliant idea that I would try something different - podcasting. You can call me out-dated but I've actually never listened to one. Google brought me to Podcast Alley which brought me to my first podcast adventure - <a href="http://www.web20show.com/">The Web 2.0 Show</a>.

I like it. In fact, I like it <em>very much</em>. It's stimulating in an entirely different way than music. It may be compared to reading a book but possibly more casual and easy going. Of course, it doesn't <em>replace</em> music and neither is it meant to. It's just relaxing and stimulating in another way.

By listening to funny people - or as in my case, smart people - I think you tune your mind to a certain frequenzy. In a way, you level with them. That on it's own is stimulating. Some say you become more and more like the people you surround yourself with and the same probably goes for the ones you listen to.

What I find is best about podcasts though, is the way that they provoke thought. The whole concept is just very productive by nature. And for me as a young developer, listening to these people is also incredibly inspiring.

Sound like a new hobby. :)
