It's been a couple of weeks since my last update but things are going fine. Still reducing body fat and will continue doing so for at least a few more weeks. Todays workout consisted of the usual bench and military press but I felt like I needed something more so I threw in a couple of supersetted flyes and side raises.

There's really not much to say, I'm going at it the same way as before. Consistent and simple, back to basics as they say. Unfortunately I'm still not eating sufficient amounts of protein but that's not really an option right now due to limited financial resources.

Because of this, I'm probably losing some muscle mass and that's a beating I'm willing to take. I don't have much to lose anyhow and every pound I lose will be gained again when the time comes. Right now, I'm all about conditioning.

So basically I feel that with my current schedule and calorie intake, results are bound to come.

However, I personally believe that one hour walks each morning sex days a week is a better way for me to reduce body fat, especially as I'm eating low amounts of protein, but I'll keep trying the interval training for a while longer. Who knows, I might gain some experience and even change my mind.

Good night and keep lifting.
