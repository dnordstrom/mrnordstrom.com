<p><a href="http://www.kingsofcode.nl/">Kings of Code</a> day one is over. The weather is perfect, Tuschinski theatre is charming and todays side-events were a great warm-up for tomorrows conference day. The seminars may not have been extremely advanced but they were nice introductions to some really interesting topics that I&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn more about.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced jQuery techniques</strong><br>
The day started off with a few advanced <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> techniques with speaker Edwin Martin. While I don&rsquo;t personally consider them really advanced, the techniques still had some nice points we could learn from.</p>

<p>For example, I hadn&rsquo;t heard of the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live">live()</a> event binder which solves the problem of having to rebind onclick events when adding elements dynamically, which will come in handy in almost every project. Edwin also gave a nice introduction to creating custom easing animations.</p>

<p>One thing that impressed me was jQuery&rsquo;s RSS parser. With jut a few lines of code, you can make an AJAX call to get an RSS feed and conveniently traverse and output it in the browser by using Javascript only. Didn&rsquo;t know that.</p>

<p>Neither did I know how fast and easy it can be to create a custom themed dynamic interface with <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">ThemeRoller</a> (though I may have suspected it.)</p>

<p><strong>&lt;canvas&gt;</strong><br>
The seminar of the <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html">canvas elemen</a>t by Marcel Beumer was something I had looked forward to. I find the idea of rendering 2D with HTML5 and Javascript to be fascinating. While the seminar itself was great and informative, it gave me the feeling that it may still be a better idea to learn Flash and AS3, rather than start playing with canvas.</p>

<p>Marcel pointed out that the advantages with HTML5&rsquo;s canvas element is that it&rsquo;s an open standard that is supported by the browser rather than dependent on a plugin, and that you will use the same toolset&mdash;HTML and Javascript&mdash;as you are used to. I completely agree and it&rsquo;s a beautiful idea which seems to already be very capable.</p>

<p>However, it may take a very long time until it becomes a standard and even longer until it&rsquo;s supported by all major browsers. Flash is already an extremely powerful platform that is being constantly improved and updated. It may be a browser plugin (and as such, an additional download) but it&rsquo;ll take a long time before more people will have a browser supporting &lt;canvas&gt; than a browser with Flash.</p>

<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s always <a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/">emulation layers and similar</a> but they are, and will be, much slower. And talking about speed, I&rsquo;ve got a strong feeling that Flash will be way more optimized as it can already render 3D at stunning frame-rates. I saw amazing examples of this at FITC earlier this year.</p>

<p>The canvas element is a nice tool and I will love to see it become an open standard. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll find somewhere to put it to good use but for now, I&rsquo;m a bit skeptic and still find Flash to be more mature, proven and optimized for the purpose of rendering heavier graphics. As the technology matures, I hope we&rsquo;ll see an increasingly powerful and fast HTML5 with great frameworks/ abstraction layers for all sorts of rendering.</p>

<p>Link recommendation from the seminar:</p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Rails</strong><br>
It&rsquo;s funny how the seminar I suspected would be least interesting turned out to be the one I enjoyed most. Before this, I&rsquo;ve never looked at either Ruby or Rails. Since I&rsquo;m used to PHP, I simply assumed it would be somewhat boring, hyped and unnecessary. I&rsquo;m glad to say I was wrong.</p>

<p>During the one hour long seminar, Menno van der Sman and Justin Halsall introduced us to Rails by building a database driven location-based search engine. I have to say, Rails really impressed me and I&rsquo;m going to another seminar about it tomorrow. It looked and felt really comfortable, quick and convenient. These guys made me want to learn more and I&rsquo;ll probably even put it to practice in an upcoming project.

<p><strong>Subversion &amp; Versions App</strong><br>
In the afternoon, Jasper Hauser and Jonathan Dann from <a href="http://www.madebysofa.com/">Sofa</a> gave an introduction to subversion and their own Mac client, <a href="http://versionsapp.com/">Versions</a>. Since I&rsquo;m actually using this application daily, there wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot of new information for me to pick up. However, it&rsquo;s always fun to hear things from other people&rsquo;s perspective, especially those who developed the application I&rsquo;m using. Besides, I really like Sofa.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a good and enjoyable presentation. Among other things, they recommended <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> as a subversion repository and I noticed them using a very nice snippet app called <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a> which I will definitely take a look at.</p>

<p><strong>iPhone app development</strong><br>
Last but not least came an excellent end of an exciting first day Since I&rsquo;m an iPhone owner and a huge fan, I of course looked forward to this seminar. Joris Verbogt, creator of the Dutch <a href="http://www.txxiapp.com/">TXXI app</a> (of which the owner is actually a friend of mine) gave us a quick walkthrough on how to create a native iPhone application using Objective-C in Xcode and Interface Builder.</p>

<p>The syntax of Objective-C may seem a bit odd at first but it shouldn&rsquo;t take long to get used to it if you&rsquo;ve ever written C or C++. Using the supplied iPhone simulator and Interface Builder, Joris showed us how to quickly build a Twitter feed interface and conveniently see it in action right there on his Mac. Plenty of fun!</p>

<p>All I can really say after this on hour seminar is that Apple seem to have made it a joy to develop for this platform and I&rsquo;d love to try it out.</p>

<p><strong>End of the day</strong><br>
My first day of my first visit at Kings of Code turned out to be warm, exciting and very educational. The atmosphere is great, the subjects are awesome and at the end of the day, both my colleague and I are satisfied and even more excited about tomorrow.</p>
