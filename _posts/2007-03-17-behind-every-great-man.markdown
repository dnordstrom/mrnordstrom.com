It continues to amaze me how even the smallest things can affect me and make me think deeply. This time it was a single sentence of a big article in Fortune Magazine. A sentence that I have read and heard many times before. It said that "behind every great CEO, there is a great woman" and I couldn't agree more with that statement.

<img width="104" height="94" border="0" align="right" alt="petra_and_me.jpg" title="petra_and_me.jpg" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin-left: 4px" src="http://www.mrnordstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/petra_and_me.jpg" />My girlfriend and I are still together one and a half year after we became life partners, even as our relationship continues to be constantly unstable. I have been deceived and let down countless times but I continue to wear my golden ring proudly because I can see the potential in her. She is still young and I know that she can mature into the woman I need by my side.

<!--more-->The problems in our relationship has made me think a lot about what kind of woman I want to enjoy the rest of my life with and as a result I have a pretty clear picture of her in my mind. I have a vision about a brighter future.

Every great man needs a woman by their side that believes in his cause and always supports him on his journey in life. This is of great importance and I personally went through a great change in balance as my girlfriend and I built the foundation of our relationship. I felt calm and complete, as if I had someone there to catch me if I fell.

Making the choice of which woman you will spend the rest of you life with may very well be one of the most important decisions you will ever make. To make your relationship and marriage last forever, I urge you to think about what you want and need in a future life partner as this will give you a stronger foundation.

I personally need my girlfriend to support me and always be there for me. I plan to do great things in my life but I will also have to face many great challenges and when the time comes for those challenges to reveal themselves, I need someone there to believe in me.

Some time ago, I had a discussion about this with an online friend. She told me that a partner is there to help you get up once you have already fallen. She is a great person but I still don't understand her thoughts on this. As I see it, a partner is there to hinder you from falling in the first place.

I read a great quote on WorldOfInspiration.com that goes like this;
"A friend is one who believes in you when you have ceased to believe in yourself."

This is so very true. Even great men are human and sometimes they will go through tough times when they struggle and begin to doubt themselves and their causes. That's when they are falling and need someone to catch them, believe in them and remind them about why they do what they do so that they can see the light at the end of the darkness.

Of course, this is a wonderful lifelong commitment that goes both ways. We need to be equally loving, understanding and supportive towards our partner. However, if we truly love the person we have chosen to share our life with, then this should be a purely blissful task that comes naturally in your relationship.

Sadly, it seems that a lot of people these days spend much more time thinking about themselves instead of concerning about other people. It's a shame to see that truly good people have become such a rare minority in Western society but hopefully this is a short-lived trend that will soon turn around.

Let me end this article with a simple quote by Winston Churchill that I truly and strongly believe in.

"We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give."
