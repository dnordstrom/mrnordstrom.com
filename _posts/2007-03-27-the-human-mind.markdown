There is a special feeling of loneliness that I sometimes feel. Today I felt it once again as I was waking up from a sleep that had swept me in a couple of hours earlier when I was lying on my sofa, reading a very interesting book. I felt abandoned.

Waking up, the only two sounds I could hear were the the one of the clock ticking and the low buzz from the electrical heater. The entire room was filled with a heavy darkness an for a few seconds, I was completely alone in the world.

<!--more-->I was thinking that this feeling that I feel at those brief moments might be a reflection of depressions that are buried somewhere deep within me and that this was their way to, for just a few seconds, show their presence. It's a scary thought. But then again, it's an equally scary feeling.

We all know that the mind is fascinating and works in mysterious ways, but what we don't know about the human mind far exceeds what we do know. We can only hope that we some day, in a far and distant future, will be able to understand what is going on inside our very own heads.

It's one of those things that are so close, yet so far away.
