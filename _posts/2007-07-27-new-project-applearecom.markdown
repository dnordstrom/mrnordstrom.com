Man, am I busy. I launched a new project about three days ago. It's an Apple fansite with iPhone wallpapers, news, videos and more. The idea from the beginning was to build a site with Apple videos, but I decided to make it a larger fansite. So how is this going?

It's going very well actually. I got more than 200 unique visitors the FIRST day and it's still going strong. Google also seems to like the site, as it already has 27 pages indexed and the domain was registered five days ago. What I'm working on right now is to monetize. As you can see, I'm currently working with AdSense but I may switch when I get approved by Azoogle, CJ and other affiliate networks.

Anyhow, I'll keep you updated on what happens. I'm expecting a stable increase in traffic as I start to rank better in Google and get more pages indexed in all the search engines. Time to get working, thank you for reading.
