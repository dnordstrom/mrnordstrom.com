This has been a truly outstanding TV week for me. First I saw the most dramatical and touching episode ever of the relatively new series Heroes. Today, only minutes ago, I witnessed one of the greatest, if not <em>the</em> single greatest, episode of the hit series '24', ever.

The character developments in this series are really amazing and this weeks episode certainly proved that.

I've been with the series for a long time and I have really had the pleasure to get to know the characters. Some of them who are now gone will be remembered forever with sadness, as great and loyal people, while others have passed away leaving less pleasant memories.

From time to time, there have been some particular episodes that have rendered me speechless and this was one of those. I simply can't find the right words to describe how much I enjoy watching these characters and the whole story develop.

As I mentioned, I've watched 24 for quite some time now and what I can tell you is that it is only getting better. Not because the episodes themselves are better than a few years ago, absolutely not. But because the story and the characters have developed in such a fantastic way.

Once you get to know the characters, watching TV shows transforms into something else entirely. It becomes a faschinating experince that you will truly enjoy, over and over again, until the grand finale after which you are left with a lot of great memories.

I will always remember John Doe, with a smile on my face...
