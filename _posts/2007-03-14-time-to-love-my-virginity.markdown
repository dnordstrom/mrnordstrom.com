Today, three days later thanks to UPS Second Day delivery, I received Losing My Virginity by Richard Branson.

When I first found the book, I knew nothing about Richard Branson. I later found out that he is one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all times with his Virgin empire,  while he at the same time is a dyslectic without higher education. That fact alone is a slap in the face of a lot of people.

I'm looking forward to reading about the creation of a great empire and I have a feeling I'm going to learn a lot from this book. Also, you should expect a review as soon as I'm done reading.
