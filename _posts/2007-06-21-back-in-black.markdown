It must have been a year ago when I first started this blog that I, through very frenetic searching, found the Black Minimalism theme and I loved it from the moment I laid my eyes on it. Like a brand new tailored tuxedo it was, looking smoother and more stylish than any other theme I'd seen. I had to have it.

But after using it for a while, some very unfortunate and vital problems came to light. You see, the theme was not compatible with Internet Explorer 6 and since many people, for reasons unknown to mankind, still use IE, I had to switch.

<!--more-->Ever since, I've been switching from theme to theme, yet never feeling really happy about the way my site looked and how the content was laid out before the eyes of my beloved readers.

Winter and spring passed by as I waited until I one day found out that a successor to this wonderful creation was being developed. Glad I were but patience is not a quality I possess. More I waited for the day to come, when the new and improved would be released to public.

That day was today so let me now proudly present to you MrNordstrom.com, back in black.
