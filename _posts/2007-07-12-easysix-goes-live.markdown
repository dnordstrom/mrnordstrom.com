It's a small guide to weight loss, made up of six steps using simplified scientific facts. I've tried to make it as simple as possible by stripping away all the information that is unnecessary for the average Joe.

The whole idea came to me when I was wondering what I should do with the esfront.com domain, since I had bought it for a past project that went down the drain. I had to come up with something fitting the letters e and s, so EasySix it was.

<!--more-->The site is mainly targeted to people who want to start losing weight or have been struggling with diet plans that just didn't work out for them. EasySix is not at all a diet, it's a no hassle way of looking at weight loss. No lies, no oversimplification, just stone cold, old school, weight loss principles that have worked for ages.

While the text is seemingly complete, I'll probably be doing some minor adjustments here and there when find something worth changing. I'm also planning to add more links and perhaps write a few tips and tricks that will help people along their dieting journey. In the end, the site is meant to be not merely about the EasySix way of weight loss. It'll be a site filled with valuable resources, everything from articles to forums.

As for promotion, I've only submitted it to a few directories yet. I don't have much of a budget to work with but I'll look into paid advertising and see what my options are. Even if it's not a cash or visitor magnet, it's still a fun project related to one of my own interests.

Health and fitness is a subject that I find both interesting and important, and it's nice to be able to contribute to a healthier world. Perhaps health is a step closer to the seemingly so unreachable world peace!

Thanks to Mikael for the wonderful logo. You've got skills, my friend.
