<p>The other day Ally again chatted with <a href="skype:d.nintera?chat">me on Skype</a>, and the name Don Juan came up for some strange reason. And now&hellip; a few days later; I felt I could relate that to web design, development and programming&mdash;anything &ldquo;work&rdquo; really.</p>

<p>Have you read anything about the tales of Don Juan? I hadn&rsquo;t, so I Wikipedia-ed the shit out of it and there are loads of information in there. Basically, he&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s greatest lover and he&rsquo;s a natural born seducer. I can relate to that too but that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m talking about us, the cyber-maniacs of the web-design-verse. It hit me like a Rolling Stone lick&mdash;we are the fucking Don Juan&rsquo;s of it all. Otherwise, why are you doing what you do, whether it&rsquo;s designing, programming, or working in a Red Light District booth? We are it.</p>

<p>Do you do it just because &quot;satisfaction&quot; of surviving another pay-day? Then get the fuck out. Seriously. Get. The. Fuck. Out. Because we, right here, we care, and we should be the Don Juan&rsquo;s of whatever it is we do.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Steve Jobs&mdash;the IT-superhero of the last three decades&mdash;so honestly and humbly put it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here to make a dent in the universe. Otherwise, why even be here?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual, he&rsquo;s precisely spot on, just like I was when I was competing at the shooting ranges years ago.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far&mdash;have come so far down the lines of text and all that&rsquo;s in-between&mdash;then you&rsquo;re most likely in it for the love. The love of the game, <em>the life</em>, baby. Congratulations, that&rsquo;s fantastic, dear!</p>

<p>And I mean that, I really do. Because by being in it for the love of your work&mdash;and possibly hate of others work&mdash;you&rsquo;ve gone from 0-60, my friend. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how fast you got, or will get, there. It&rsquo;s only that you are there that matters, and nothing else.</p>

<p>Money and the love for it, the greed, or just the necessity of having a job, may get you to 60, that&rsquo;s for damn sure. It will get you far further too if you have enough of that shit in you. But there&rsquo;s nothing like being in it for the love, the hate, the opinion-ation of you inner crazy self.</p>

<p>Money is a great motivator&mdash;you need it for survival&mdash;it&rsquo;s primal instinct. All-too-natural-mindfuck of the 2000 or so past years.</p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;the real deal&rdquo;, you know. I&rsquo;m right now above the clouds, watching the sun set outside my window seat on the plane I&rsquo;m riding. It&rsquo;s beautiful to the point of undescribable-ness so I won&rsquo;t even try. Point is, is your work that beautiful, in your own opinion? If not, do you want it to be?</p>

<p>Then you&rsquo;re on the right track, baby&mdash;your very own track, just where you should be. You&rsquo;re doing something right; you&rsquo;re in it for the love. Continue down that path and nobody else&rsquo;s, and you&rsquo;re already my own personal idol.</p>

<p>Money is numbers. Love is magic. Do the math, and then continue down your path. Pretty please with cherries on top.</p>

<p>Fuck &ldquo;show me the money!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Show me the love&rdquo; instead!</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mizwizzy" title="Fantastic web designer and developer!">@mizwizzy</a> mentioned something on Facebook relating to me and something called &ldquo;profanity&rdquo;&mdash;had to Google that. Personally, I care about crazy-ass-wise-ass-ness, and throwing in an F-grenade at someone tends to make them think just a lil&rsquo; bit more about what you&rsquo;re saying. My love to you though, Ms. Wizzy! :) And I think this post kinda tuned it down a bit actually, but don&rsquo;t get used to it!</p>

<p>Wow, this sunset is love(ly). <time datetime="2011-08-15T21:38:00+01:00">9.38 PM</time> and about to land but I&rsquo;ll remain in the clouds because this is a great day, and a great decade for all of us. Rock on.</p>
