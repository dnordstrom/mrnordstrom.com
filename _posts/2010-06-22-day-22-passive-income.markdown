<p>It seems everywhere you go, you read about the importance of generating passive income for your business&mdash;income which just flows into your bank account on a monthly basis. But is it really that passive?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The last example of this I&rsquo;ve read was in the book <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/freelancer1/">The Principles of Successful Freelancing</a>. It&rsquo;s a really good book but the few particular paragraphs about this so called &ldquo;passive income&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t as smart as they may seem.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve debated and thought over the decision of offering web hosting as a service for my clients. Web hosting is one of the passive incomes that are discussed in the book. The thing is: web hosting is far from passive income.</p>
<p>While you might be very lucky and avoid this, imagine what will happen when the client cannot configure her email client properly. You will get a phone call. You will re-send the account information she has lost. You will try for 30 minutes to guide your client through the configuration process.</p>
<p>Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your hourly rate? $100? That means if you spend five hours on support requests every month, that is $500 of potential lost income. Unless you have hundreds or thousands of clients, if you spend more than $500 monthly on web hosting you&rsquo;re getting royally ripped off.</p>
<p>Another example is CMS licensing which I consider to be even more dangerous. First of all, if a client pays to run his production site using your CMS and he finds a fatal bug, who do you think he&rsquo;ll call? That&rsquo;s right&mdash;you.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll may very well be spending a lot of time bug fixing, doing sales and answering support requests. The more recurring revenue you make from services or products like these, the more time you&rsquo;ll spend and the more potential income you likely lose.</p>
<p>As a general guideline, I don&rsquo;t offer web hosting to clients. Currently there are two client sites hosted on my own server, and they belong to my &ldquo;regulars&rdquo; which are great clients and very easy to work with.</p>
<p>As I made my decision, I asked for advice from <a href="http://twitter.com/andyrutledge">Andy</a> of <a href="http://unitinteractive.com/">Unit Interactive</a> on Twitter, and he says that Unit doesn&rsquo;t offer web hosting either. Like me, they of course assist in finding the <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">right hosting solution</a> but they are not hosting providers themselves.</p>
<p>Think long and hard before you decide to offer something new. If it&rsquo;s passive income you want, make sure that it really is passive, and not a nightmare waiting to happen. My advice is to keep your business simple and focused on what you do best.</p>
