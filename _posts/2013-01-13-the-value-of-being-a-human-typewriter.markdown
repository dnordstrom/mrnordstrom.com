It was back in the old days---we were two sixteen year old hackers in an IRC chat room, and it was probably long past midnight. My friend half-jokingly told me my writing looked like that of a human typewriter, and at the time I took it more as an insult than a compliment. But that statement stuck with me, and with time my view of it has changed.

She didn't mean that my writing was sterile or boring, or at least I hope she didn't. She meant that I used capital letters at the beginning of sentences, that I tried to put a comma where it was supposed to be, and that I used em-dashes and semi-colons religiously (I always have). She meant that, as a young Swede caught up in a global web, I was constantly striving to perfect my writing. Formal or informal, in Swedish or in English---none of it mattered, and it still doesn't.

For some reason, this will occasionally make people think you are weird. That never stopped me, and neither should it stop you. Catch a football enough times and it will eventually seem magnetically attracted to your hands, at which point it doesn't matter that some think you're weird: you'll be a receiver for the New England Patriots, they won't be. The same principle applies to writing. Strive for perfection in both formal and informal writing, and soon enough it will become a reflex.

Soon enough formal and informal will fade away. You will start thinking in better terms, terms like efficiency and comprehension. Your choices and decisions will become based on making your reader get what you're trying to say. That is the goal of most of our writing, yet many of us pay little attention to it. We get caught up in our own thoughts, forgetting that our readers are not as familiar with them as we are.

By paying more attention, you will be better understood in any situation---that is a fact, a simple consequence of consistent effort. I would go as far as to say it will also improve, though to a lesser degree, your verbal communication skills. If doing something takes a little more effort and makes you a lot more efficient, common sense should tell you to do it. That is also my advise to you, and why I'm writing this right now.

I still have a long way to go, but being an obsessively compulsive typewriter has taught me a lot. It has taught me about the art of writing, and about the science and value of efficient communication. The statement that started this article, however, still to this day makes me remove a comma here and there, just to at least *sound* human in a world that increasingly is not.
