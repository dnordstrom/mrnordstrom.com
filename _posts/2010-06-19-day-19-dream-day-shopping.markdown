<p>This Saturday is Dream Day! A few days ago, I received this book &ldquo;The Principles of Successful Freelancing&rdquo; for my Golden Post Award on SitePoint. It suggest writing a shopping list for your business. Sounds like a nice idea and to make it fun, why not dream a little while we&rsquo;re at it?</p>

<h2>Got hobbies?</h2>
<p>The first thing I&rsquo;m thinking right now is podcasting equipment, since I&rsquo;m listening to <a href="http://boagworld.com/">Boagworld</a> as I write. Let&rsquo;s have a look at what podcasting hardware there it.</p>
<p>First of all, we can buy a podcasting package, and Samson has one that has received a four-star rating <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B000H4MZU2/ref=nosim/danbenjamin-20">on Amazon</a>. It&rsquo;s probably the most simple way to get started recording more professionally and it costs just above $100. Not bad.</p>
<p>It would however be truly awesome to have <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm7b-vocal-microphone">this Shure SM7B</a> microphone. $350 at Amazon isn&rsquo;t that expensive for a professional mic I guess, but it&rsquo;s still more than I would put into a podcasting setup for now.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.behringer.de/EN/Products/C-1.aspx">Behringer C-1</a> seems to be an option that does a great job without breaking our wallets. At around $45 on Amazon, this would be one of my finalists if I were buying a mic right now.</p>
<p>Then apparently we need a audio preamp/interface to be able to use the mic. M-Audio is a nice brand I like, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/B0000TP57E/ref=nosim/danbenjamin-20">here&rsquo;s</a> a nice one for $99. Another Behringer product is the <a href="http://www.behringer.de/EN/Products/MIC200.aspx">MIC200 preamp</a> which we can get for as little as $60&mdash;nice choice.</p>
<p>Headphones we all probably have, though it could be nice to have a set of real studio headphones. Anyway, this is not a podcasting post so let&rsquo;s move on. What else could we want to buy?</p>
<h2>Equipment (A.K.A. gadgets)</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.mrnordstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/0909display_30.jpg" alt="30 inch Apple Cinema Display" title="30 inch Apple Cinema Display" width="500" height="312" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1151" /></p>
<p>Personally, I already have an Apple Cinema Display and an eco-friendly printer, though a 30-inch display would kick ass. Speakers are fun, but I have those too. What I do want is some more memory in my Mac so that would be at the top of my list. Another thing would be a hard drive for my laptop&mdash;a 160GB SSD disk would surely speed up the old champ!</p>
<h2>Goal!</h2>
<p>Instead of materialistic happiness, let&rsquo;s talk about business expansion. A big nice-to-have is of course a great office space in a nice location, since I&rsquo;m now in my home studio. It&rsquo;s very comfortable but I don&rsquo;t think I can cram many employees in here unfortunately.</p>
<p>I was looking at a full-service place in Amsterdam a few months ago which would be a decent place to be in, however expensive. Maybe a bit corporate for a web agency but still, it&rsquo;s very neat. The best thing would of course be a place near, or in, the centre with cool interior. Take a look at <a href="http://www.officedesigngallery.com/">these spaces</a>&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t that be just fantastic?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To be honest, I can&rsquo;t think of many more material things. The most fun things would be this business expansion, and traveling&mdash;hiring a great accountant, hiring employees, going around to conferences around the world, and travel with my fianc&eacute;e at least 4&ndash;5 times per year.</p>

<p>So ideally, the &ldquo;business shopping list&rdquo; that started this thread should be prioritized to achieve those goals&mdash;pretty smart, huh? The morality of all this is to think before you buy, and making this kind of list I guess can help a lot with that. </p>
<p>Instead of just <em>spending</em> your money on crap, figure out what it is you really want to do, and <em>invest</em> an appropriate part of your income to achieve that. It&rsquo;s business 101&mdash;some call it common sense, yet a lot of people do the opposite.</p>
