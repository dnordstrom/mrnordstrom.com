We have prevailed by having, in my opinion, the overall best company website in the area. The internet has such great potential for interactivity and since it also is a very affordable communications medium, I suggested creating a newsletter.

The company website has received very good feedback from customers since it allows them to easily browse products online and a newsletter would further increase interactivity, making it possible for them to conveniently receive information about new products without the need of even visiting the site.

<!--more-->Since we're dealing with small business, I chose to create a small format newsletter, appropriate for product news, and to eliminate costs by finding an open source script for the technicalities. Since I'm keeping the newsletter short and simple, I decided to do the whole thing in Photoshop and skip most of the HTML by sending subscribers a JPG of the newsletter as well as a link to a hosted version. So much for the technical specifics.

Visual integration is important to maintain a healthy brand and company image so I kept that in mind during the creative process, making the newsletter visually similar to the website and using a font similar to the one in the logo. The company is not only a small-town business but also 20 years old so I created an old fashioned overall look and layout.

As for copy, there's really not much to tell. I'm keeping the text simple yet long enough to fill the space nicely, while also trying to make the customers interested enough to visit the store.

Voila! The result is presented in the image above.

I thank Mikael for the wonderful background images. Take a look at his portfolio, he's talented and does great work.
