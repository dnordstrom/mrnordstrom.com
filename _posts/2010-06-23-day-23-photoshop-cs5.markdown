<p>As you know, Adobe Creative Suite 5 was recently released and the new version of Photoshop has a few quite interesting features.</p>

<p>This is a very brief example of what can easily be achieved with the new 3D features in Photoshop CS5. I took a photo of my cat, added a bunch of adjustment layers and finally turned it into a ring using the 3D tools.</p>
<p>I am not a designer, which proves that all this is very easy to do, and of course a lot of fun to play around with. If you want to have a closer look at what CS5 has to offer, I suggest you check out the great <a href="http://kelbytv.com/photoshopusertv/">Photoshop User TV podcast</a> by The Photoshop Guys.</p>
