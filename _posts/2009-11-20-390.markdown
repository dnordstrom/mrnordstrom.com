Had a seizure in the office this Monday, epilepsy style. Can't remember any of it since I blacked out for 10 minutes but when I woke up there was two nurses standing over me. Some say I&rsquo;m overworked but I don&rsquo;t feel very stressed. I think it&rsquo;s just something that happened but I&rsquo;m going to the hospital here in Amsterdam to check it out just in case. I mean, if I&rsquo;ve got epilepsy I&rsquo;d like to know about it.

Been blogging way too little lately, so here&rsquo;s a tiny status update. First of all, I&rsquo;ve started a new company, a web shop, with my father and a friend. It&rsquo;s called IZE.se (<a href="http://www.ize.se/">fritidskl????der p???? n????tet</a>) and I&rsquo;m handling the technical aspects such as development, design, photo editing/uploading and hosting. 

The shop is running on a <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/product/community-edition">Magento Community Edition</a> platform and the plan for me is to sell some good quality outdoors clothing for great prices in Sweden while pushing them with social networking and word-of-mouth. Ecommerce is more difficult than one may think but I believe we&rsquo;re three people who are good in three different areas and we&rsquo;re selling some pretty good products. It&rsquo;s an interesting experience for me and hopefully it&rsquo;s a matter of time before things start moving.

Besides that, I&rsquo;ve also started doing some work as what I call ???????interactive agent???????. This means I&rsquo;m taking care of someone else&rsquo;s interactive needs, such as web sites, email addresses, social networking, home networking, you name it. The idea is to take care of the technical work that normal people don&rsquo;t enjoy so that they can focus on what they truly love. In the case of my first and favorite client, <a href="http://www.lacledesoul.com/">La Cle de Soul</a>, it&rsquo;s singing. Working with artists and other creative people is something I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time and it&rsquo;s amazing to finally be able to do it.

That&rsquo;s about it. I&rsquo;m looking forward to start blogging more&rsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a whole bunch of post-it&rsquo;s with stuff that needs to go online. Until they get transferred to the screen, here&rsquo;s a list of a few people who produce some pretty nice Tweets now and then. Dofollow these and you shall be enlightened:
