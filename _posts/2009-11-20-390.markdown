Had a seizure in the office this Monday, epilepsy style. Can't remember any of it since I blacked out for 10 minutes but when I woke up there was two nurses standing over me. Some say I��������m overworked but I don��������t feel very stressed. I think it��������s just something that happened but I��������m going to the hospital here in Amsterdam to check it out just in case. I mean, if I��������ve got epilepsy I��������d like to know about it.

Been blogging way too little lately, so here��������s a tiny status update. First of all, I��������ve started a new company, a web shop, with my father and a friend. It��������s called IZE.se (<a href="http://www.ize.se/">fritidskl����der p���� n����tet</a>) and I��������m handling the technical aspects such as development, design, photo editing/uploading and hosting. 

The shop is running on a <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/product/community-edition">Magento Community Edition</a> platform and the plan for me is to sell some good quality outdoors clothing for great prices in Sweden while pushing them with social networking and word-of-mouth. Ecommerce is more difficult than one may think but I believe we��������re three people who are good in three different areas and we��������re selling some pretty good products. It��������s an interesting experience for me and hopefully it��������s a matter of time before things start moving.

Besides that, I��������ve also started doing some work as what I call �������interactive agent�������. This means I��������m taking care of someone else��������s interactive needs, such as web sites, email addresses, social networking, home networking, you name it. The idea is to take care of the technical work that normal people don��������t enjoy so that they can focus on what they truly love. In the case of my first and favorite client, <a href="http://www.lacledesoul.com/">La Cle de Soul</a>, it��������s singing. Working with artists and other creative people is something I��������ve wanted to do for a long time and it��������s amazing to finally be able to do it.

That��������s about it. I��������m looking forward to start blogging more��������I��������ve got a whole bunch of post-it��������s with stuff that needs to go online. Until they get transferred to the screen, here��������s a list of a few people who produce some pretty nice Tweets now and then. Dofollow these and you shall be enlightened:
