I'll be focusing a lot on <a href="http://www.appleare.com" target="_blank">Apple Are</a> now and will only be doing minor projects on the side. Since my <a href="http://www.esfront.com" target="_blank">EasySix project</a> was in need of promotion, I decided to sell it to someone who has time for it. When projects stand still, something needs to change. This time that meant selling.

The site had fairly little content but it still had great potential. The content was unique, written by me, and it came with a great set of promotional banners and a logo in vector format. It also included a couple of weight loss tools, such as BMI calculators, and integrated AdSense and Amazon affiliate.

I put it up for auction at <a href="http://forums.digitalpoint.com" target="_blank">Digital Point</a>, my favorite place on the internet. After a couple of days I got a bid of $85 and decided to sell. The money will go into my new projects and promotion for Apple Are. Hopefully EasySix will now be in good hands and grow with time.
