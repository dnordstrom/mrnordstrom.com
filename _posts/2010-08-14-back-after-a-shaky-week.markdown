<p>Came back from the hospital a couple of days ago. Had to spend some time there after having an epileptic seizure last Friday since the doctors wanted to investigate. Apparently, they suspected it may be a brain tumor but fortunately it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>You know, I&rsquo;ve had these seizures 2-3 times now and they aren&rsquo;t much fun at all. For those of you who are wondering, it&rsquo;s a bit different than seeing it on TV. Let me try to explain.</p>

<p>Imagine just sitting somewhere, doing something trivial. I was sitting outside with my family, playing with their parrot whom was sitting in my lap. That&rsquo;s the very last thing I remember, then I just woke up on the ground feeling totally disoriented, with no idea what had happened.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s quite fascinating. One second everything is exactly as usual and then, boom, you wake up on the ground. Apparently my eyes rolled up, I got stiff and fell head first to the ground where I started shaking very rapidly for about five seemingly long minutes.</p>

<p>Once you wake up, you&rsquo;ll be somewhat retarded for a while. My 12 year old sister sat next to me and told me an ambulance was on it&rsquo;s way. Since I had no idea what was going on&mdash;ironically I had been told what had happened but didn&rsquo;t really <em>get it</em>&mdash;I wondered if I was going to live or die. My father said he got worried when I started asking &quot;where the fuck is the ambulance&quot;, and even more so when my pulse got so low he couldn&rsquo;t feel it.</p>

<p>When the ambulance finally arrived, the guys helped my up but apparently my legs didn&rsquo;t work so I had to be carried to the ambulance. Needles were shoved into my arm and I was repeatedly asked questions that were unusually hard to answer, like what day it was and when I was born.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m better now but apparently the nerves in my neck are messed up, so the left side of my body is weak&mdash;my left arm feels numb all the time. I&rsquo;m also a bit tired and have occasional headaches and nosebleeds but hopefully all this will get better in a week or two.</p>

<p>If you happen to be around when something like this happens, stay calm. If you can, make sure the person doesn&rsquo;t fall badly and get hurt. Do not put something in the mouth or try to protect the tongue&mdash;you might just get your fingers bitten off. If the person is diagnosed with epilepsy, you might want to hold off on calling an ambulance unless the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Once the seizure is over, talk calmly and explain to the person the she has had a seizure and (possibly) that an ambulance is on the way. As long as the person doesn&rsquo;t fall very badly, it&rsquo;s not dangerous but the person will be confused for a while.</p>

<p>Big thanks to my 12 year old sister who did a fantastic job at this. I am truly amazed and will never forget that she could remain so calm and supportive in a situation that would surely make most adults panic.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s back to business as usual, hoping my arm will improve and that I will soon get some time over to create more blog posts and podcast episodes!</p>
