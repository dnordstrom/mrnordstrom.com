Sailing in a sea of blissful suffering. Walking the midst of loneliness and misery. Blinded by darkness that surrounds the beauty. My eyes fill with tears of happiness as I realize that this is it.

<em>"All imagination pales into nothing compared to what your real life is right here and right now. There's not a single dream you can have, no matter how pure or beautiful, that's better than what you're living through right now no matter how lousy you think right now is."</em>
