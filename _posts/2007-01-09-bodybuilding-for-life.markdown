Let me start out by clarifying to everyone that I am not what you would call big. I am not even near big. In fact, I am 143 pounds and 5'5". I am probably what you would call cute!

But even so, I love working out. I am blessed to have found an activity that gives me so much in return for the effort I put in. Working out five days a week is a small price to pay for the enormous return of investment you get.

Two years ago I was a completely different person than I am now. I was a smart kid and I thought I loved what I did. But the problem was that I rarely ate breakfast, I sat at my computer for 10 or more hours a day, and I was depressed. My health was hitting rock bottom.

<!--more-->Then something happened. My best friend decided he wanted to start working out at the smallest and cheapest of all our local gyms and of course I had to come along. At first I felt a little intimidated by all the guys being bigger than me, but I then realized something.

The sport of fitness, bodybuilding or whatever you want to call it is not just about growing big. Sure, on the surface it is. But underneath the surface lies a great journey where you search for answers about who you really are. A journey where you evolve and learn.

You see, bodybuilding and fitness has changed my life in so many ways. In the beginning there was the obvious health benefits of working out. Not just my physical health, but also my mental health began to spike. My mind suddenly became a lot clearer. It was as if I had been walking around with a clouded mind all my life, and suddenly everything was crystal clear. Of course everything wasnâ€™t crystal clear, but thatâ€™s how it felt.

After some months of working out five days a week, I began to see the sport though a different perspective. I began to love each training session. Working out suddenly became the greatest thing in the world for me, and not just because I saw physical results but because I began to think differently.

I began to understand the concept of discipline and hard workâ€¦ You see, the stricter my diet was and the harder I worked out, the better my results were. And that is a true and basic lesson for life! I have those beautiful and heavy metal plates to thank for being such a disciplined person as I am today.

Above all this, working out has introduced me to inner peace. This is something that cannot be explained, it simply has to be experienced. After a couple of months at the cheapest gym available, I bought a gym card at perhaps one of the best gyms in Sweden and I consider it to be one of the greatest investments I have ever made. I was suddenly working out with real bodybuilders and fitness models, and watching them has taught me many things.

I can honestly say that most of the fitness models and bodybuilders I have had the privilege to talk to are some of the nicest people I have ever met. Even though some of these people look like they are the most dangerous people in the world, they are so nice, understanding and helpful.

What I am trying to communicate is that working out can and will change lives. Donâ€™t believe everything you see, for appearences can be deceiving. Working out does not necessarily have to mean going to the gym, just taking a walk every now and then is a really good thing. But if you feel like taking the next step and buy and gym card, donâ€™t be scared or intimidated. We are all humans, arenâ€™t we?
