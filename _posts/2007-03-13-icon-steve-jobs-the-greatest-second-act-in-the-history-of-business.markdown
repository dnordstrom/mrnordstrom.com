I remember lying in my bed late that night reading the introduction. I am a person that has no patience at all and therefore donâ€™t like introductions. Even so, this one rendered me speechless.

Starting off by describing one of the greatest moments in Steveâ€™s life, the author really captured my attention from the first page. The introduction was for me very deep since I felt that I could, on some level, connect with Steve. To a certain degree, I can see myself in him. It was truly touching.

From that moment on, I had serious problems putting the book down.

<!--more-->It started by describing the beginning, Steves childhood and the characteristics that led to his success and the creation of the greatest technology company in the history of mankind. Everything from his problems in school to his spiritual trip to India is described vividly.

What the book clearly focuses on is the development of Steves personality as he experiences all the challenges and changes in his life. His personality is so fashinating and complicated, yet it can be so simple depending on how you look at it. This makes the stories really hard to explain but this book still does a great job of doing so.

The book is by no means a mere glorification of Steve. Sometimes it in fact seems like the opposite, as if the author doesnâ€™t like him. From time to time, Steve is critizised roughly for the actions he has taken in the past and the way he went about things.

But as the fantastic moments of his life comes along, the author properly describes Steve as the talent he is. This makes the book a very pleasant and intellectually satisfying mix of critizism and praise, about one of the very greatest men in history.

This is by far the best book I have ever read. Steve Jobs character is insanely fashinating and the story of how he has matured is equally amazing. The book describes Steve Jobs as exactly what he is, and does so in a way that makes it so interesting that you also will have serious problem putting it down.

By the age of 25, Steve Jobs had achieved more than most people do in a lifetime. 25 years later, he is an icon that has reshaped not one, but three indsutres. In my opinion, Steve Jobs is a legend.

Reading his story not only inspired and motivated me. In a way it also changed my life.

5/5 - Insanely great!
