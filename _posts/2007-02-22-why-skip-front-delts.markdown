As you may have noticed from my training schedule, I do not currently work my front deltoids. I put the word 'currently' in there because I have worked them before and I may want to work them in the future. Anyhow, the reason for this became pretty obvious for me today.

I was visiting my new gym for the first time yesterday, and it was time to work my chest, shoulders and triceps.

As usual, I started out with five sets of bench presses and then went on to do five sets of standing military presses. Finally I ended the workout by doing four sets of close-grip bench presses and three sets of rear delts. 

What do you think hurts most today?

Front delts.

Therefore, I do not isolate on my front deltoids. I see many people do heavy front raises but personally I think it's overkill. Bench- and military presses simply beats enough shit out of them as it is.

As always, this is only my opinion and my opinions are based on my body. Always do whatever you believe works best for you. As long as it isn't really stupid, of course.
