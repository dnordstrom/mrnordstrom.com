<p><blockquote>&ldquo;I&#x27;m leaving, on a jet plane. Don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll be back again.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>

<p>I ask myself; how does it feel to leave it all behind? It was a lot tougher the first time but I learned to live with it and kind of go with the flow, take it for what it was. And besides, you&#x27;ve got so much on your mind when you move to a country you have never even visited, that you barely have time to really feel anything. Aside from the time it takes to organize yourself, you&#x27;re also overwhelmed by a new culture and new impressions.</p>

<p>Following this thread of thought, I ended up thinking about past times. When you&#x27;re right smack in the middle of the present time, currently experiencing a time-period you&#x27;ll later look back on, your thoughts are distorted. You&#x27;ve got all this clutter around you that infects your point of view. Well, most of us at least. We just can&#x27;t see clearly because there are clouds of emotions and worry in front of us.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s like Steve Jobs said in his Stanford commencement speech. &quot;You can&#x27;t connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards,&quot; or something like that. It&#x27;s true. When I was in LA, I couldn&#x27;t see clearly because I had a lot of problems in my way. Of course, I had a great time but it doesn&#x27;t justify what I see now that I look back on that period of my life.</p>

<p>At the time, I had a whole bunch of problems to deal with. But you know what I later realized? When I look back at it, despite all that, those were the happiest days of my life. They were the <em>happiest days of my life</em>. I didn&#x27;t have my girlfriend, I didn&#x27;t have so much money, but none of that mattered. They may give you satisfaction at the time but in retrospect, trouble, worries and material things just disappear.</p>

<p>What I remember is not problems. What I remember is the feeling of riding my bike along Venice Beach an afternoon in September. It&#x27;s not the most beautiful place in LA, but there&#x27;s something special about rolling down the bike lane with some music in your iPod, watching the people as you pass them. There&#x27;s this satisfying contrast between the many people and the calm ocean, as a slight breeze comes along making the heat bearable.</p>

<p>What I remember is the wonderful feeling of walking down the Third Street Promenade on a late Friday evening. I remember the calmness of relaxing at Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf, slowly sipping a cup of flavored black tea, patiently waiting for it to cool down. Sitting outside, you can hear a street performer sing a beautiful song as she&#x27;s stroking her guitar to an orgasm of beautiful tones.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s funny how time gives you perspective that brings out those wonderful moments. Question is; why bother to worry when it won&#x27;t matter anyhow?</p>

<p><blockquote>&ldquo;Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy.&rdquo;
<br><em>&mdash;Leo F. Buscaglia</em></blockquote></p>
