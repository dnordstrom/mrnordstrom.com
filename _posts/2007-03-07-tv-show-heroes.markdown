I just watched the 17th episode of Heroes and I am deeply shocked and amazed. Just as series such as Smallville and 24, I have enjoyed this one since the first episode. And just as some very special episodes of Smallville and 24 has, this one managed to affect me very deeply.

It's truly amazing to see an episode, or an entire show for that matter, so perfectly compiled. If you watch a show that you love, then some day you too will experience an episode that totally blows you away and leaves you completely breathless.

Everything from soundtrack to cinematics added to the experience of this episode but what really touched my heart is the insanely incredible story, which has unfolded for weeks and finally come to a climax.

It's moments like these that makes life worth living. I'mÂ thankfully left truly amazed.
