<p>Spent last night finally installing Snow Leopard on my MacBook Pro. I haven&rsquo;t noticed much of a difference to be honest, but it seems to be working quite well. Aside from one thing; PlugSuit Agent.app.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This app kept asking me for my password over and over again. Ever time I opened an application, that popup would be there to make my life miserable. Luckily it turns out there is a simple solution for this issue.</p>

<p>PlugSuit apparently isn&rsquo;t compatible with Snow Leopard and needs to be disabled. So just go to System Preferences and PlugSuit, and hit ???????Disable???????. That&rsquo;s it, your life is saved.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to go Google what PlugSuit actually is because I have no idea.</p>
