The choice to actually order the book proved to be an excellent such because I learned a lot during the two-three months it took me to read it.

<strong>Inspirational</strong>

The title tells you most of what the book is all about. The two authors are trying to apply their Marine Corps training in the private enterprise and does a very good job at it. 'Effective leadership' is what the book teaches to everyone from supervisory to middle management to senior management.

<!--more-->At times, it may seem like the authors are taking glorification of the Corps to the outer limits, but at the same time, the Marines may very well be just as tough as they make them out to be. However, the fact that their are glorifying the 'rank and file' by explaining their discipline and dedication only makes the book more inspirational.

<strong>Practical</strong>

As you may already have figured out, I enjoyed every page from cover to cover and it thought me some valuable principles. The best thing about the book must be how the authors make real, practical examples out of every single small chapter throughout the book. This makes it very practically useful as well as easy to understand.

Not only do they explain very well how the Marines do it, they also tell you what you can do to achieve the same goal within your company, as well as how to do it. While some of the tips and tricks are more useful than others, this book is an overall good investment for anyone, not only managers and supervisors but also entry level employees.

<strong>The bottom line</strong>

This is a recommended book, full of practical tips and tricks, for everyone from entry level employees to senior managers.
