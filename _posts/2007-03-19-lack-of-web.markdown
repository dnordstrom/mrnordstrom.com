As much as I want to update this blog with new posts on a daily basis, at the moment I am unable to do so due to a lack of internet connection. Until this unfortunate problem is solved I will continue trying my best to update the site as often as possible.

Acquiring an internet connection is in fact not as simple for me as it may sound in the ears of those who were born and raised in America. I am an international student and will only be staying in the country for a short time while I am studying.

<!--more-->This means that I cannot commit myself to a 12-month contract. I also don't have a social security number and those two problems narrows the number of options drastically. On top of that, I don't have a phone line and I'm not planning on getting one as I am fully satisfied with my Motorola Cellphone. DSL is therefore out of the question.

Cable seems to be the best way to go and I'm currently looking into other cable ISPs trying to find a feasible option. Many of them seem to require their customers to sign a 12-month agreement though, making the hunt an ISP tough.

As I was writing this, a lovely person at Mac Forums replied to my post and I now have a few options to consider. Hopefully, I will be back in business in no time at all. Until then, have a great week and be sure to bookmark this site so you know your way back!
