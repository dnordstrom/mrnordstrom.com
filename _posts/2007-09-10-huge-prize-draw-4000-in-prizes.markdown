I just couldn't resist this one. David Airey is celebrating the 1 year anniversary of his <a href="http://www.davidairey.com" target="_blank">logo design</a> blog (with 1700 subscribers) by giving away a whole lot of stuff. Normally, I wouldn't give in to this kind of stuff because it just isn't worth the time and effort it takes to enter, but the prize list is just huge.

It's not just the gold, silver and bronze prizes that make this thing attractive, though I could definitely use one of those. There's also a podcasting kit donated by <a href="http://www.affiliateblog.co.uk/" target="_blank">Fraser's Affiliate Marketing Blog</a>, 2GB USB sticks donated by <a href="http://www.terinea.co.uk/blogs/terineatechtips/" target="_blank">Terinea Weblog</a>, and blog reviews from <a href="http://blog-op.com/" target="_blank">Blog-Op</a>, <a href="http://www.milienzo.com/" target="_blank">miLienzo</a> and <a href="http://www.marketing-tools-review.com/blog/" target="_blank">Marketing Tools Review</a>. And a whole lot more.

Only thing you need to do is to post something similar to this on your blog.

But that's not the only reason for posting this, of course. Last but definitely not least, I'd like say <strong>happy anniversary</strong> to David and congratulate him on a remarkable achievement. 1700 subscribers is a job well done, to say the least. And for those of us who like design and branding, the blog is a gold-mine with real high quality content.
