I said to a friend of mine today that it is probably a better idea to look at the actors you like than to look at the IMDB Top 250 list, because peoples taste in movies obviously differ - a lot. And it is, to a very large part, the actor or actress that makes the movie. At least if you like me are looking for an valuable experience and not some shallow two hours of mere entertainment.

Movies for me work the same way as music. If it isn't deep or at least somewhat beautiful in some way, then it's not interesting and then it can get the fuck out of my computer. I do find ways to enjoy most movies though and of course, the best movies are those in which you have to actually THINK and LOOK FOR the beauty to find it.

Anyway, I thought I'd blog about it rather than giving that particular person a half hour lecture because who the fuck cares about my taste in movies anyhow. I mean, here at least you have the option of reading or not. So here we go.

<strong>Bill Murray.</strong> This is a <em>cool</em> guy, that's how I would describe him. What is he, fifty? He's got all the good qualities of a fairly old man and he acts young in the sense that he is unique, fresh and well, just so damn cool. Check out Groundhog Day, Lost In Translation or why not Ghostbusters.

<strong>Scarlett Johansson. </strong>Speaking of Lost In Translation... There's something about this half-Danish girl. She seems so down to earth, calm, personal and, well, cute. Not much more to say about her, she's a great actress but I guess I like her because of her glowing personality. It brings <em>warmth</em> to her characters, to say the very least.

<strong>Johnny Depp.</strong> Call me mainstream but this guy is just fucking amazing. Most people don't remember what he brought to movies like Edward Scissorhands. He IS that movie. Blow is a personal favorite, the ending just ripped me apart in all ways possible. Hell, we should rename him <em>Johnny Depth</em>.

<strong>Al Pacino.</strong> This is just a legend. Ever since The Godfather, he's been at his best for 20 years or so. He is Scarface. He is Michael Corleone. I guess he shares Heat 50/50 with Robert DeNiro but still. Amazing actor is all I can say, just watch him step into his character and totally <em>own</em> it, and I really mean that.

<strong>Kevin Spacey. </strong>Now were taking things to a whole new level. This one is one of my absolute favorites and if you've seen American Beauty and K-Pax, then you know what I'm talking about. You may not have seen Pay It Forward but it brought me to tears. When I think of it, all his mentioned movies probably did. Deep, just fucking <em>deep</em>, that's all.

There's just too many great people to even mention in a single post. Look at legends such as <strong>Marlon Brando</strong>, <strong>Christopher Walken</strong> etc. Too good to be true. We have the Pulp Fiction crew of oldies such as <strong>Samuel L Jackson</strong> and <strong>John Travolta</strong>. Sometimes they're deep and sometimes they're not, but they're good. Great, even.

Female actresses such as <strong>Sandra Bullock</strong> who did an awesome job lately in Crash. Guys like <strong>Denzel Washington</strong> that can turn the crappiest script in the world to an Oscar nominee. Check out American Psycho or The Machinist and you'll see some of the potential of <strong>Christian Bale</strong>.

Donnie Darko showed an amazing <strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong> and Mulholland Drive brought us some fairly unknown young stars. <strong>Edward Norton</strong> is another fairly young actor with much left to prove to us. I mean, there are just too many. Don't tell me to pick one because I simply can't. They're all unique and bring <em>something</em> of their own.

I've got a bunch of favorite movies and a bunch of favorite actors/actresses. But if you with me this far, then you've probably got a pretty good idea about my taste in movies. It doesn't matter if it's independent or blockbuster. It's not about budgets and it's not about stories.

It's about depth of character and that's what all these amazing people bring us.
