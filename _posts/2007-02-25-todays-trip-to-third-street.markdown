My friend Erik and I decided to take the bus down to 3rd Street this beautiful but chilly Saturday afternoon to take it easy for a few hours and perhaps look at some clothes. Arriving at 4th, we walked straight to Coffe Beans on 3rd where we sat down for a medium cup of coffee which looked more lika a large cup of coffee to me. Anyhow, it got us enough energetic to begin our trip down the street.

While we had a good time watching all the street performers, we couldn't find any great clothes. Of course, there were a lot of decent jackets and such, we're talking Third Street Promenade here. But we just couldn't find the perfect outfit, you know.

While we still didn't have any luck with our shopping, we found something else entirely; <strong>Bob Cicherillo</strong>.

For those of you not into the sport of bodybuilding, Bob Cicherillo is a very well known bodybuilder. He was bodybuilding before most of you were even born and he won last years Masters. This guy is huge, but not only that. He is also extremely symmetrical and seems to be an incredibly nice guy. Thumbs up to the champ!

We left Bob and Santa Monica Place behind us and once again went up 3rd. Erik found a nice shirt at GAP but other than that, nothing. Just when I was about to give up and head home, I saw the light. A shining sign saying 'A|E'.

Inside the Armani Exchange store, things finally changed. After only a few minutes I found the perfect jacket. You know the one you put on and go 'wow, this is awesome'. Just the kind of jacket I was expecting to find hours earlier. I happily????handed my VISA card????to the nice lady at the cash register.

What did I learn on this trip?

<strong>I am an Armani kind of guy.</strong> Definitely.
