<p>As you can see, there has been some changes around here. Aside from switching to a HTML5 and CSS3 powered front-end using @font-face, I&rsquo;ve also switched the back-end from WordPress to <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>It all began as I was reading a comic strip about someone who proudly told a developer that he had made a site in some CMS I believe it was. The developer replied that it was stupid, and wondered why he just didn&#x27;t use Jekyll with a &quot;cap deploy&quot; command. So I wondered; what was this Jekyll stuff?</p>

<p>Turns out Jekyll is a &ldquo;static site generator&rdquo; which means it takes template files from different folders and mixes them into a static site. The philosophy is to instead of reinventing the wheel, to use existing tools like markdown, textile and Liquid to create a nice way of managing a website.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll give you more details about my implementation later on in another post. For now, just know that I&rsquo;ve switched from WordPress to Jekyll for this blog and so far I&rsquo;m loving it. And I'm using Capistrano and the &ldquo;cap deploy&rdquo; command to publish my changes too but that&rsquo;s nothing new.</p>

<p>Why did I make the switch? We&rsquo;ll, mostly to learn a new tool but I also love the flexibility that Jekyll offers. It&rsquo;s very barebones and I like that&mdash;makes it easier to change things. After some simple permalink configuration and .htaccess tampering, most of the links are still working as well.</p>

<p>The idea in the future is also that I&rsquo;ll have this very basic layout template and be able to apply custom CSS with unique styling for some posts, which Jekyll will be an excellent tool for.</p>

<p>I was already writing my posts in HTML back in WordPress, so going to Jekyll seemed natural. Here I can choose to use markdown, textile and other markup languages too but HTML will give me more control if I&rsquo;m going to have unique styling later on.</p>

<p>Note that I&rsquo;m not saying Jekyll is better than WordPress. It&rsquo;s not attempting to be a complete publishing platform. It&rsquo;s just different, and it suits the purpose of this site.</p>
