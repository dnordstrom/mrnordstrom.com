I've had some trouble before which resulted in a few reinstallations of OS X and I even used Windows for a few weeks before taking the time to fix the problems.

As almost every software, Mac OS X can sometimes be troublesome but unlike most software it runs incredibly smooth when it works. I love Apple and Macs because of their simplicity and clean style.

For those interested in what software I use, my beloved MacBook is currently running the lastest version of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Mac OS X</a>. I use my favorite web browser, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>, with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> as backups. Firefox is so overrated... <a target="_blank" href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">Transmission</a> for torrents and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> for FTP. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Apple Mail</a> for email and of course <a target="_blank" href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/photoshopcs3/">Photoshop CS3 Beta</a> for my image editing needs.

In addition to that, I use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> for music and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adiumx.com/">AdiumX</a> for instant messaging. I would probably use iChat if my friends weren't all on MSN. I have tried the Jabber workaround and actually got it working but it ain't for me. But I'm not complaining, Adium is a beautiful peace of software!

As for the hardware, I have a MacBook that is connected to a wireless accesspoint. Beside my MacBook I have a PC with a TFT monitor which shares a keyboard with my Mac using <a target="_blank" href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy</a>. I use my PC as a fileserver which I access through Windows shared folders and I control my downloads via uTorrents new web GUI, so I rarely use the monitor.

Oh, and last but not least, I also have my Marantz equalizer connected to my Mac to give that sound a little extra touch before it comes flowing out of my speakers.
