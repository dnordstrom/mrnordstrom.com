<p>Taking a day off from the longer type of posts, I&rsquo;d just like to recommend a small tool that makes life easier. Have you ever used <a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com">InstantDomainSearch.com</a>? If not, you should start now.</p>

<p><a class="imagelink" href="http://www.mrnordstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/instantdomainsearch.png"><img src="http://www.mrnordstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/instantdomainsearch.png" alt="Instant Domain Search" title="Instant Domain Search" width="504" height="246" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944" /></a></p>
<p>InstantDomainSearch is a fantastic tool. It&rsquo;s an AJAX powered domain search site&mdash;simply type in whatever domain name you want and it will check whether or not it&rsquo;s available as a .com, .org, .net and so on.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s incredibly useful. This is actually how I came up with the name of my company. Realizing that &ldquo;Nordstrom Interactive&rdquo; is a rather long name for a company and perhaps hard to pronounce, I decided to shorten it.</p>
<p>So I simply went to the site and started typing in N Interactive letter by letter to see what the shortest pronounceable work was that was still available. I&rsquo;m very happy with the result, which ended up being the seven letter name Nintera.</p>
<p>From that I registered both <a href="http://www.nintera.org/">nintera.org</a>, <a href="http://www.nintera.net/">nintera.net</a> and of course <a href="http://www.nintera.com/">nintera.com</a>. My email address is simply d (at) any domain name which is very easy to remember and quick to type.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this tool and I&rsquo;d like to thank the people behind it for providing it. If you find a domain name you like, please make sure to click the affiliate link to register it so that the kind people get something in return.</p>
