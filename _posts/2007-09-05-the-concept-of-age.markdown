Hey guys and girls, long time no see. I'm ???????a little??????? busy these days and that's why I'm not writing. The last couple or so weeks I've been writing my Apple blog and created a network of proxy sites that now require VPS hosting, which is fun but expensive. Anyhow, I was inspired by Joanne and her blog <a href="http://j-amusement.blogspot.com/">The Laidback Buddhist</a> to start writing some personal stuff here again.

But it's a blog about online entrepreneurship, you say. Well, it's my blog and I can write whatever I want to, end of discussion. Surely I'll give you my tips and tricks on blogging and running proxies when the time comes too, don't worry. But this girl made it impossible for me to resist replying to <a href="http://j-amusement.blogspot.com/2007/09/defying-age.html">her post</a> about age (and stuff).

Age is interesting. Is age about time, years and days, or is it a measurement of maturity? God I hate these subjective trick questions. As with almost every other concept on this messed up planet, age is what you make it. While someone considers it a measurement of years you've lived, another can divide age into categories, ???????child???????, ???????boy???????, ???????adult???????, ???????man??????? etc., with different levels of maturity. But what is it for me personally?

It's nothing. Just another fucked up concept with millions of different interpretations that doesn't mean anything because everyone has a different point of view. But it's interesting, I'll give you that. I'd like for age to be a measurement of achievement, how about that? Do we really grow ???????older??????? if we aren't learning anything new or moving forward in life? No, we're standing still. While we may grow physically, we're standing completely still mentally.

But still, people argue that they are ???????getting older???????. Sure, if older means getting closer to dying then you're absolutely right. But isn't that a pretty sad way of looking at it? ???????Life is sad??????? you may argue. It doesn't have to be, I say. You decide what and how your life is by taking a stand and choosing point of views. Learn to do it on-the-fly and I guarantee you an interesting life, though you may feel weird at times.

Joanne, there's no objective way of determining your mental age or maturity. It all depends on our actions, morality, right and wrong; subjects that are called subjects because they are all so damn subjective. There's no real point in listening to anyone else's opinion in the matter than your own, because who're you going to listen to? The guy over there saying you're really mature, writing mature stuff on your blog, or someone else saying you're a messed up little girl spending your spare time posting pointless stuff in a virtual world that ???????doesn't really exist????????

I say fuck age or make up your own definition of it and stick to that. That's what great people do. They create their own worlds, with their own laws, limitations and goals and they only let people in that are on the same frequency. That's how to excel, I'm telling you. I know it's harsh, but fuck everyone. Now, there's much more to it, don't misunderstand me. I'm not a selfish bastard, though I may feel like one from time to time.

No, I'm sot saying anyone should stop caring, I'm just saying you should stop caring too much about other people's opinions. If you care to much about their opinions, they'll consume you. DEFINE YOURSELF, that's the point I want to get across. Damn, we're pretty far away from the actual subject now, aren't we? Let me get back on topic by saying; you are as old as you think you are, your own definition of yourself is the only one that matters so don't let others opinions define you.

???????We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another; unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, and future mingle and pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made up of layers, cells, constellations.???????
