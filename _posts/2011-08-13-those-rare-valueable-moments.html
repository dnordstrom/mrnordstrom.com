<p>Hello crazy people, the ones whom I love so dearly!</p>

<p>As mush as I hate starting a post with the word &ldquo;I&rdquo; (sounds so fucking ego, don&rsquo;t you think?): I was just talking to a (literally) pretty new contact on Skype (yeah, you Ally). We were discussing for a few seconds those moments in life that you actually remember, just for a while. You know, not the ones you forget as soon as you wake up in your bed (on bathroom floor, which has happened&mdash;thanks to K for that memory which I&rsquo;ll certainly remember that forever, dear).</p>

<p>No, we were talking about the shit you cherish, love and remember forever and ever. Even if you don&rsquo;t know it it at the time, these moments are the ones you&rsquo;ll remember. Sometimes for life, but at least for a few years. And why am I rambling about this now and here?</p>

<p>Well, because we&mdash;the techies, workaholics, alcoholics, narcotics, nut jobs, assholes and wonderfully lovely people&mdash;should perhaps open our eyes to these moments a little more. For once, I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit it!</p>

<p>People have told me (a programmer, partner, entrepreneur and so much else you wouldn&rsquo;t even believe) my whole life&mdash;the life I can remember&mdash;that I work too much. I should get out more. Get some more sun in your face, Daniel! I either didn&rsquo;t understand what they meant or just bluntly ignored the ass out of them, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure, but I sure as hell didn&rsquo;t listen because I tend to listen mostly to myself.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been there too, I&rsquo;m all too sure. So let&rsquo;s think a little about it. Not that bullshit about &ldquo;getting out more&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s think about the moments. The very tiny, rare, beautiful and crazy moments that you either loved or hated (which one doesn&rsquo;t matter). Let&rsquo;s just think about it for, let&rsquo;s say, two minutes, starting now!</p>

<p>Because I know there are a lot of people like my old self (well, two week old self but who cares about time anyway) out there, that don&rsquo;t give a good god damn about these moments, and think that work, technology, programming, designing, or whatever, is the shit; it&rsquo;s the best thing in the world. And hell yeah it is, it fucking is&mdash;for people like us, that&rsquo;s the shit!</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t forget the moments. Think back, and try to remember them, because they&rsquo;re valuable, so valuable they&rsquo;re magical, heavenly things. And the best thing is, you can have them whenever you want, really. It&rsquo;s up to you whether you want to live your life or die your life, if you get me and what I&rsquo;m saying.</p>

<p>Bottom line&mdash;what I&rsquo;m trying to say is&mdash;we live too little. Most of us. Most of us don&rsquo;t live at all, and it&rsquo;s sad.</p>

<p>Actually, believe it or not, this really is a technical post, and it&rsquo;s damn well work-related, because I&rsquo;m pointing my finger at <em>you</em>. You, right there, behind your desk, monitor, in your comfy chair that you use about 10 hours a day. Are <em>you</em> living your life right now like you lived your life in those magical moments?</p>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t think so. Why not? We&rsquo;ll it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I just implore you, go do so. Not next week, not tomorrow, not next minute, but now.</p>

<p>Because, again, why not? I know you can come up with a million excuses at least, but trust my guts and ignore those excuses. They&rsquo;re just messing with you. They&rsquo;re outta get you and I say fuck them.</p>

<p>Go live&mdash;take your life into production environment. Hit the big red button.</p>

<p>PS. So <a href="http://twitter.com/stommepoes" title="Mallory">Stomme Poes</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/gidogeek" title="Johan Bruning">Gidogeek</a> and all of you other Europeans reading, do you wanna have a shot of tequila tomorrow? I&rsquo;m up for it&mdash;question is, are you? ;)</p>

<p>(Coffee is another, less lethal, alternative by the way.)</p>
