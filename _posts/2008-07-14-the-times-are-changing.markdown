Just wanted to let you know I'm not in England anymore. These days I'm working as a PHP developer for MARS media in beautiful Amsterdam. Well, actually I just got here a week ago but why wouldn't I feel like home?

From what I've seen so far, it's a great city. Somewhere inbetween Sweden and England I think, no <em>really</em> as modern as Sweden but charmy and well, not as sucky as East Midlands. Maybe I'll write some more about that stuff later on but right now I'm a busy man.

So what do I do? Short and sweet - Drupal. Seems to be a damn good CMS so far. A littly tricky at first, sure, but once you get underneath the hood things tend to make sense after all. Master the chaos and prevail, right?

Anyway, I'm still alive which means that you may just see some more serious posts in the coming months. Maybe.
