It was several years ago that I started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Telling-Lies-Marketplace-Politics-Marriage/dp/0393321886">Telling Lies</a> after finishing Paul Ekman's more recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emotions-Revealed-Paul-Ekman/dp/0753817659">Emotions Revealed</a>. While Emotions Revealed can be considered a relatively light read on the subject of emotions and their relation to deception, Telling Lies is fascinatingly deep on the subject of lying itself.

The cover reads "clues to deceit in the marketplace, politics, and marriage". While this subtitle is accurate, it does not quite reflect the complexity of what is described within the frames of the book. More so than just clues to deceit in both everyday and highly deadly historical situations, it to my delight goes into detailed discussion on the morality and rationality of the described predicaments.

When Lyndon B. Johnson lied about the Vietnam war, did he deceive only the American people or did he also deceive himself?

Should the ignorance that lead to the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle be blamed on the single person ignoring the many warnings from engineers, or should NASA managers be held accountable for creating an atmosphere where lying was authorized and even encouraged?

Though this book was published in 1985, it may still be the most accurate and thorough book on the subject of behavioral clues to deceit. This because it's based on solid research leading up to, and building upon, the discovery of micro facial expressions and other clues in body, voice, speech and autonomic nervous system that changed the way behavioral scientists view deception, and because it bravely questions past research for being focused on utility as opposed to accuracy.

An important fact clearly stated throughout the book is that there is no universal sign of deceit. There are only universal signs of emotion. The polygraph machine does not detect deceit; it detects arousal of any emotion. The book goes into fascinating depth on what questions we may ask ourselves and others to not misinterpret or misunderstand emotions and the motives behind them.

This book was not written just for Norwegian investigative journalists. Anyone will benefit from learning how to be more understanding and sensitive to the behavior of others. As a word of caution, if you believe that ignorance is bliss you may want to stay far away from this book -- it opens the door to many questions regarding ethics and an individuals right to emotional privacy.

Last but not least, literally, the epilogue of the book is full of insight and gives us a glimpse into the mind of one of our time's greatest scientists:

> My sympathy is more with the lie catcher than the liar. Perhaps it is because my scientific work is a search for the clues to how people truly feel. The disguise interests me, but the challenge is to uncover the real, felt emotion beneath it.
>
>Discovering how felt and false expressions differ, to find that concealment is not perfect, that the false only resembles but differs from real expressions of emotion is satisfying.
>
> The study of deceit, in these terms, is about much more than deceit. It provides an opportunity to witness an extraordinary internal struggle between voluntary and involuntary parts of our life, to learn how well we can deliberately control the outward signs of our inner life.
