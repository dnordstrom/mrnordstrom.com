I've decided to do some restructuring of the site later this week. As you might have read, I've written an article about how to blog successfully and I think it's time to take my own advice. Especially now when I've got another blog project to work on.<p></p>The point of restructuring is mainly to narrow down the content. I believe the blog will benefit from this because quality will be higher when focus is on fewer subjects. The blog as it is today is very messy with a lot of categories and not enough posts.<p></p>Which categories I will trash and which I will keep will be decided within a few days and the change will take effect during the weekend. I'm planning to put focus on some of my personal thoughts and opinions but mostly on my projects and work in progress. <p></p>By the way, I'd like to thank you all for reading. I'll make sure to be more active after this change.
