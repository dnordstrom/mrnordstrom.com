...is the headline of an interesting and entertaining article I stumbled upon this afternoon. I thought I'd share it with you, my loyal readers. Personally, I agree with everything in the article except for point five about reinventing website navigation.

It's about time for someone to put some innovation into website navigation. I mean, come on. It's been the same for ages. Even here, at the home of the great innovator, the navigation is at the traditional top. Let me express myself by quoting the great Franklin Delano Roosevelt<em>;</em>

Yamaha Design is trying, but are unfortunately breaking a lot of the golden rules stated in the mentioned article. Anyhow, thumbs up to the designers at Yamaha for trying something new!
