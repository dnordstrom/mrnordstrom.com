<p>We&rsquo;re at the very last few days of #30daysofcreativity and I&rsquo;ve been talking about my new site where I&rsquo;ll be collecting presentations from different conferences, <a href="http://www.speechesarehot.com/">SpeechesAreHot.com</a>. After hitting some minor obstacles along the way, the site is now live.</p>

<p><em>This is post 27 of 30 for <a href="http://30daysofcreativity.com/">#30daysofcreativity</a>.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nothing huge, just a very simple site for embedding videos. That&rsquo;s it. The purpose is to simply gather videos for those of us who can&rsquo;t (yet) afford to regularly fly around the globe to attend these things.</p>
<p>The site was originally built upon the <a href="http://symfony-reloaded.org/">Symfony 2 PHP framework</a>. Since it was built upon the preview of the new Symfony version, it required PHP 5.3. Unfortunately&mdash;as I was deploying the site&mdash;I discovered the the MediaTemple (dv) still runs PHP 5.2 which means the site wouldn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>So I had two choices: either I upgrade to PHP 5.3 and risk my client&rsquo;s sites going down, or I migrate to a different platform. Since I prefer keeping my clients, I chose the latter. Besides, it&rsquo;s always fun to learn something new.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually wanted to try out <a href="http://expressionengine.com/">ExpressionEngine</a> for quite a while now so it wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal. A couple of hours after downloading it and pulling up the documentation, the site was running on ExpressionEngine 1.6.9, which by the way is built on <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>&mdash;another framework I enjoy working with.</p>
<p>It seems though that you&rsquo;ll never get to play around with any code using this platform. It&rsquo;s great since it&rsquo;s very client friendly, but I&rsquo;d personally rather use Symfony and have some more fun. However, this is a site that shouldn&rsquo;t take up much time so it&rsquo;s a rather good choice after all.</p>
<p>The result of building this quick site was that I learned both a new framework and a new blogging platform. I&rsquo;m happy with that, and I hope that you&rsquo;ll find it useful as well. Keep checking in&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be adding more videos whenever I come across a good one.</p>
<p>By the way, it&rsquo;s using a lot of CSS3 so if you&rsquo;re using an old browser you&rsquo;re screwed and I don&rsquo;t care. And instead of complaining about the design, help me create something cool. I&rsquo;m a developer.</p>
