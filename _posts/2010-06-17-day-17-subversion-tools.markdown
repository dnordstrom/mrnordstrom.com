<p>Version control is a very important aspect of web development that too many developers overlook or just ignore. Until very recently, I was using my own Subversion setup on my <a href="http://mediatemple.net/">MediaTemple</a> dedicated-virtual server.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;m testing Springloops. I was positively surprised and I really like it so this episode will show you how the system works and how the deployment works.</p>
