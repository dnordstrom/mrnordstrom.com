<p>A brown package was delivered to my mailbox last week. The postage told me that it had been shipped all the way from the US. More specifically, it was sent from Culver City, California��������from the offices of <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/">MediaTemple</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Inside was a very neat t-shirt with the (mt) logo on it, and of course a bunch of cool stickers. Last but not least, there was an envelope containing a hand-written note from my friends at my favorite hosting company.</p>

<p>This is yet another reason to love MediaTemple and a great example of how to take care of clients. We should all learn something from this.</p>

<p>I know you&rsquo;re reading my blog so thanks a lot, I really appreciate it. Hopefully I&rsquo;m moving another one of my clients over to a (dv) service in a week or two. The Magento driven web shop will feel right at home in the cozy Virginia data center.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to moving the site. Even though we&rsquo;re located in Europe, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend any other hosting provider. We&rsquo;re actually cutting costs while increasing performance, which is really wonderful.</p>

<p>Keep it up, all of you. I wish you a great week!</p>
