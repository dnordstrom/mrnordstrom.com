<em>I'm hungry.</em>

I'm hungry because haven't eaten much today. But as I weigh in at below 130 lbs, I better get used to the feeling of being hungry if I want to reduce bodyfat. There is no reason to feel sorry for myself, no one is forcing me. I have chosen to do this with my very own will.

Sometimes I wonder why I do what I do. For what reason do I punish myself and my body every single day? But suddenly, when my sanity is returned to me and I can once again think clearly, I realize that it is not punishment I do but something else entirely.

<!--more-->All the aspects of fitness and healthy living brings something back to you. You get a beautiful as well as healthy body that will be strong and last long. The health benefits are huge but still you get so much more. The mental aspect is as much overwhelming as it is unexplainable.

I strongly believe that fitness and bodybuilding can, and will, bring you much, much more than merely good physical health and great esthetics. It will bring you closer to <em>balance</em> in life. It will teach you about discipline, respect and hard work. It will make you a stronger and better human being.

Anyhow, this was just something that came to my mind as I was sitting here at Starbucks this evening, feeling the hunger growing inside me. Feeling  increasingly hungry, I still made the choice not to eat yet because it would mess up my calorie intake.

For you people who haven't tried the lifestyle and sport of fitness and bodybuilding, this might seem strange. But I would like to say something to those of you who do understand.

Don't give up, don't give in. We do what we do for a reason. Remember that.
