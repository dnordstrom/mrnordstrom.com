<p>&ldquo;Ladies and genitals!&rdquo; How are you? How have you been? It&rsquo;s been a long time once again and it&rsquo;s good to be back in the saddle of this ever-changing thing I&rsquo;ve got going here on the site.</p>

<p>Now jumping straight to the point: this thing will right now, right here, take a 180 degree turn. Well, not really, I&rsquo;m exaggerating just a little, but still there will be changes. They will be substantial and I&rsquo;m confident you&rsquo;ll quite like &rsquo;em!</p>

<p>You see, I&rsquo;ve come to a fantastic realization&mdash;I don&rsquo;t write as much as I&rsquo;d like to. I don&rsquo;t write as often as I&rsquo;d absolutely love to and used to, and I don&rsquo;t love it as much anymore. The cause of this is not relevant to this post but I&rsquo;d gladly share them with you in an email if you&rsquo;re interested enough to pop me one, or simply dare add me on Skype at <a href="skype:d.nintera?add">d.nintera</a>. ;)</p>

<p>The thing is that for the past year or two&mdash;I&rsquo;m not exactly sure&mdash;of the long existence of this textual outlet this has been a purely technical blog. From now on, that will no longer be the case. It will still be technical, trust me on that. &ldquo;The web&rdquo; is what I do, simple as that. It&rsquo;s what I do best, it&rsquo;s what I love, have loved and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll continue to write about.</p>

<p>However, there&rsquo;s more to the world than that and there&rsquo;s certainly more to write about than that. My publications will inevitably be technical by nature because that&rsquo;s the kind of dude I am. But it will be louder, more opinionated, broader, and I&rsquo;ll hopefully&mdash;very, very hopefully&mdash;write a whole lot more because of that.</p>

<p>So I suppose that if you&rsquo;re into that sorta stuff, it&rsquo;s a win-win for both of us!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to explain in such a short post but what I&rsquo;m saying is that unlike just technical tips, tricks and how-to&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;ll instead be a place of venting thoughts and crazy-as-hell opinions that are messing with my head constantly&mdash;perhaps even some emotions hidden between the lines!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve simply decided that instead of letting them be messing with&mdash;and be contained within&mdash;that shell of insanity versus genius we call mind, these oddities will be written down and publicized right here. You may like the noise or you may not, but it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;ll be here whether you want it or not!</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s all for tonight. It&rsquo;s 4AM, so yeah, it&rsquo;s night (but still my usual madly addicting hours of business and productivity). The shit just hit the fan. But it&rsquo;ll have to wait just a little (I promise) bit, because right now I need some sleep because I have one of those absolutely crazy (and?) wonderful human beings of this hellish world to talk to tomorrow. Even I need sleep. Sometimes.</p>

<p>So you guys, girls, gentlemen and women, have an absolutely wonderful day or night, depending on where in the world it is you hang your hat after your long days. We&rsquo;ll chat soon. Sleep tight, dream on, work hard, and keep up whatever it is you&rsquo;re doing, so long as it&rsquo;s making the world a better place, all right?</p>

<p>Ciao!</p>
