<p>Something I haven&rsquo;t seen on the web is a blog and podcast for web design clients so I decided to start my own. Clients too should have a source of information regarding hiring and working with us designers and developers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At the moment, it&rsquo;s nothing more than a bare-bone WordPress/PowerPress setup but with time, I&rsquo;ll hopefully fill it with some valuable information for those who pay our rent. Every time a client asks a questions that could be interesting to other people, the answer is likely to be posted on the blog.</p>
<p>So what kind of information may this be? Well, we have things like working with Google Docs, the benefits of Basecamp and other project management tools, productivity tips, basic design and typography theory, inspiring industry stories&mdash;anything of interest to a client.</p>
<p>My client wiki already has information such as how to digitally sign a document, and I&rsquo;ll continue to add to it. While the wiki is a resource mostly for my own clients, the blog will be a source of information for anyone hiring a web design agency or freelancer.</p>
<p>I have no idea how or when I&rsquo;ll find time to actually write on yet another blog but that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll have to figure out. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>The URL is <a href="http://slashclient.com">SlashClient.com</a> and I'm planning some adjustments to the minimalistic WordPress theme in place as well.</p>
