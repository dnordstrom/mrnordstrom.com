Promotional material is something every site should have, at least for future use so there's no need to rush it when the time comes.

The site is about weight loss. More specifically, it's a beginners guide to weight loss; I have personally written it with the intention to simplify. Regular people shouldn't have to study nutrition to lose some weight, right?

So, we want to promote simplicity (or ease of learning) and associate it with the science of weight loss. This made me think of the phrases "a piece of cake" and "as easy as pie". They're among the most widely used phrases to promote simplicity, so the job was almost done for me.

All I had to do was to switch cake and pie to healthier alternatives, namely salad and tuna. I signed the banner by placing a small EasySix logo in the corner, and I was done.
