Well, more about that in another post where I will be telling everyone about my system so that those interested can take notes. For now, just check the screenshot.

The theme contains some new neat fonts and my goal is to keep everything as clean and simple as possible. If you like it, you can download it at DeviantArt, a site I recommend for all your geeky customization needs. Nah, we all want our OS to look its best, don't we?
