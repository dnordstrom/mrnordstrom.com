I love WordPress. There's nothing you can't do with it; there's plugins for everything. I just found a great plugin for readability statistics. But why would you want to see those?

Word count and other statistics is a great way to determine how easy your text is to read. After all, we're not blogging for ourselves; it's our readers that read. And we should naturally do our best to make it comfortable for them, right? (<em>I.e. you want high AdSense earnings, right?</em>)

This little plugin does the job for you. Well, it doesn't write the text for you but it checks the readability so you can do the appropriate changes. It checks word and sentence count; and calculates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning-Fog_Index" title="Gunning-Fog Index" target="_blank">Fog</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch-Kincaid_Readability_Test#Flesch.E2.80.93Kincaid_Grade_Level" title="Kincaid Grade Level" target="_blank">Kincaid</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch-Kincaid_Readability_Test#Flesch_Reading_Ease" title="Flesch Reading Ease" target="_blank">Flesch</a> formulas. It's pretty much all you need. I miss one thing though: words per sentence. But I can do that on a calculator. Now, is this really important?

It is. I just finished reading Andy Maslen's copywriting book and it clearly states the importance of readability. No matter who you're writing, you should make sure your text is easy to read. So if you want to keep your readers reading, I recommend getting this plugin.

This was the results for this post. According to these numbers, it should be extremely easy to read.
