<p>Before you start reading - this is just a nonsense post to pretend I'm writing regularly. Over a month since the last post and I should feel ashamed. Shit, I do feel ashamed but it's not that bad when you think of it. You see...</p>

<p>I just got a comment from my bro Erik whom I haven't heard of in ages. A pleasant surprise in the spring darkness of Amsterdam. I've just been to Sweden to catch up with my people over there too, mostly Mike and Stefan. Thanks for taking the time, guys!</p>

<p>Now it's back to business (like it ever left my mind). Trying to sweep this development stuff under the rug so I can start doing interaction design full-time. It will happen, it's just a matter of time. Hell, it could happen tomorrow if I decided to but there's a need for Drupal-mindedness over here and I have to take care of it.</p>

<p>It's time for the agency to step up and accept what's coming to it. What's coming?</p>
