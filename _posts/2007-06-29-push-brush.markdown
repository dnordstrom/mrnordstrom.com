Then it hit me how convenient it would be to store toothpaste in the same kind of bottle as those liquid hand soaps. We'd just have to 'push and brush'.

Here is a quick prototype of my idea of this toothpaste. I'd buy it if I could but I haven't seen it on the shelves at my local supermarket. Not yet.

<em>Crest Sensitivity. </em>

<em>No more tubes. Just push... and brush.</em>
