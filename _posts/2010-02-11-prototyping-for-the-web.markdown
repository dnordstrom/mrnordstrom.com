<p>Prototyping is an enjoyable and useful aspect of web design. Itâ€™s interesting. Having created a standardized workflow for interaction design at my previous place of work, Iâ€™ve gotten myself some insight into how to do it and what software to use. I love picking out software and trying new alternatives. Itâ€™s what keeps our minds educated and minty fresh, donâ€™t you think?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just now Iâ€™m watching a video podcast from Web Design TV (from the people of .net magazine). Itâ€™s episode 38 where Axure is introduced and demonstrated as a prototyping tool. Now, at the beginning of the podcast itâ€™s mentioned that a big agency was wondering if the podcaster knew of a good prototyping tool, since they were currently using Adobe Illustrator. The podcaster goes on to bitch and moan about using Illustrator as a prototyping tool.</p>
<p>What Iâ€™m wondering is; why would you use Illustrator as a prototyping tool and who on earth would do that? Itâ€™s a design and illustration softwareâ€”an excellent suchâ€”and just by looking at the website one can conclude that prototyping is far from any of its purposes. â€œAdobeÂ® IllustratorÂ® CS4 software is a comprehensive vector graphics environmentâ€.</p>
<p>Adobe offers another toolâ€”Fireworksâ€”which as you probably know has to sole purpose of allowing you to â€œrapidly prototype and design for the webâ€. Now, if thereâ€™s a piece of software by a manufacturer that is truly meant for prototyping, why use another one that is meant for something completely different? Of course, designers are comfortable with Illustrator but that doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s the right tool for every job. Anyway, you all know this. Iâ€™m just confused as to why â€œthe makers of .net magazineâ€ would mention Illustrator as an alternative (however bad) for prototyping and leave out Fireworks. </p>
<p>Axure, however, seems like a pretty neat alternative. While Fireworks does prototyping with PNG files, Axure does it with HTML which a lot of people seem to think is a great idea. Since Iâ€™m not a fan of software generated markup, this is not a selling point for me. I just see no use for it since Iâ€™ll write my own markup anyway.</p>
<p>What does matter for me is Mac compatibility and Axure is lacking it. Itâ€™s game over immediatelyâ€”itâ€™s no longer a valid alternative. So what tools do we Mac people have to satisfy our prototyping needs?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Adobe Fireworks</strong> â€” $299 â€” <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/">link</a><br>As mentioned, this is a rather nice alternative. I personally enjoy using Adobeâ€™s software and donâ€™t mind putting my design eggs in the same basket. Adobe software is very commonly used so why not learn how to use it all? Sounds like a good idea to me.â€¨</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OmniGraffle</strong> â€” $99.95 â€” <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/OmniGraffle/">link</a><br>The Omni Group is one of my absolute favorite software companies. I use their OmniFocus GTD application extensively and have been using OmniGraffle for mockups and sitemaps a bunch of times. Very fast and easy to use, and not nearly as expensive as Adobe software. Very much recommended!</p></li><li><p><strong>Mockingbird</strong> â€” Free â€” <a href="http://gomockingbird.com/mockingbird/">link</a><br>Youâ€™ve got to live this piece of software. Mockingbird is a wire framing and prototyping web application. Itâ€™s snappy, smooth and runs entirely in your web browser without using Flash. Oh, I almost forgot; itâ€™s free. From the look of it, it seems to be based on the very interesting Cappuccino Framework in which you can build fantastic web apps in Objective-J. Try it and love it.â€¨</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HTML</strong><br>Iâ€™ve read interesting articles on the subject and while it doesnâ€™t suit every project, I like the idea of rapid prototyping using markup and some simple CSS. When youâ€™ve settled for a final design, if you do it properly, youâ€™ll have a foundation to start building upon immediately. It may sound like it takes a lot of time but if you get used to it, I believe itâ€™ll save you time in the long run. That is, if youâ€™re proficient enough in HTML.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thatâ€™s just a few alternatives and thereâ€™s a lot more out there on the internets. If youâ€™re interested, I suggest you do some Googling and see where that takes you. As I mentioned in the first paragraph, trying out alternatives is what keeps our minds fresh and young. If you really donâ€™t like searching for new stuff to play with, then at least you have four excellent alternatives here to choose from.</p>
<p>But really, learn to love trying out new stuff. Itâ€™s good for you!</p>
