I mean, StumbleUpon is something you use when you're either looking for inspiration or are really, really bored, right?

At least that's why I use it. So you might imagine my surprise when this highly useful site popped up in the middle of all the flash games and YouTube movies.

Instant Domain Search lets you search for domain names in <strong>real time</strong>. No need to stretch for the return key to submit those nasty forms you usually use, just type some and you get some. Very useful when you're trying to find an available and not so bloated dotcom name on a so very bloated internet.

Check it out, fall in love, and bookmark it.
