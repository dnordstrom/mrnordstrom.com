So there I was, yesterday, the sun was shining and I was enjoying all the good that jQuery brings. Then suddenly I found out that Drupal 5 is using version 0.1-alpha something of this sweet framework. Well actually it's 1.0.4 but still - it's <strong>obsolete</strong>!

I might add that Drupal 6 comes with jQuery 1.2.3 though. Actually, the decision to go with jQuery was largely based on the fact that Drupal comes with it and that all (well, almost all) Javascript modules use it. This is nice and I'm not complaining (much).

Good news - there's a module. There always is, plenty of fish in the sea. <a href="http://drupal.org/project/jquery_update">jQuery Update</a> brings any version of Drupal the latest version of the framework. Excellent stuff that I really recommend, just activate it and it <em>should</em> be done.

There are, however, people that luck doesn't constantly follow around. My own JS menu was behaving very nicely all day but I had some problems with Drupal's form resize grip thingy. After the update it wouldn't let go of my mouse pointer when resizing.

If you too have this problem, you may want to try using the module but download the jQuery.js file from the <a href="http://jquery.com/">official website</a>. Worked for me.

We'll see if I can soon post a few lines of Javascript that turns your menu dynamic. I'll have to run it by a few people first I guess, now that I'm not writing the stuff just for myself and my goof projects. 

Now headin' home, goedenacht!
