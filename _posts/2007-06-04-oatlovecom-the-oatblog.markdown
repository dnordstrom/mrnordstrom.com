As you might have read on this site, I have been working out for almost two and a half years now. During that time, I have eaten oatmeal almost every single day so I thought 'why not make it a hobby?'

After two and a half years of trying to master the art of oatmeal, I have developed both skill and taste. I may be far from the best chef in the world, but oatmeal I know. Therefore, I am now announcing the start of The Oatblog, located conveniently at <a href="http://www.oatlove.com" target="_blank">www.oatlove.com</a>.

<!--more-->The mission of The Oatblog is to provide you with the tips, tricks and recipes needed to make the perfect oatmeal, pancake, bread or anything else that contains oats as an ingredient. But I'm not putting just any recipe there. First it has to be tested, tasted, photographed and approved by me personally.

A larger goal with the site is to promote a healthy lifestyle. I want to show people that oats can be both healthy and delicious at the same time, and that making a healthy breakfast doesn't have to take time. Many of the oatmeal recipes can be made in 5 minutes.

Enjoy The Oatblog at <a href="http://www.oatlove.com" target="_blank">www.oatlove.com</a>.

"Everything oats!"
