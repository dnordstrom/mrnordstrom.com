<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve made another episode for my new podcast. For this one, I just thought I&rsquo;d quickly show you what extensions I&rsquo;m using most often in Google Chrome.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Hopefully most of you are already using some extensions but if you don&rsquo;t, I strongly recommend it. Instead of writing a blog post with a list of &ldquo;top extensions&rdquo; like so many others, showing how they actually work is a lot better.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t mention anything special here&mdash;I&rsquo;m simply going through the extensions I have installed so that you get some inspiration and tips.</p>
<p>Right before the end of this episode I also take a quick look at a few of the many new features in Safari 5 for Mac.</p>
