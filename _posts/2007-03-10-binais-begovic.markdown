There was an unusual amount of wires and photographic equipment at my gym the other day when I went there expecting a regular chest/shoulder/triceps day. Apparently, a photo shoot was ongoing in different corners of the Hammer Strength filled facility. 'Neat', I thought, and preceded to the bench for some warm-up sets.

Surprisingly, we found out that he also is a Swede, just like us. He also seems to be a very nice guy and that further proves what I've been saying for a long time; that the fitness industry is the home of lots and lots of great people.

All in all, it was a pretty cool experience to see a real photo shoot and meet with one of the big guys. Go ahead and check out his website!
