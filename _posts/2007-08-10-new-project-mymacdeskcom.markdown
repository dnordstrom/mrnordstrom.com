Hi, long time no see. I'm staying busy, blogging at <a href="http://www.appleare.com" target="_blank">Apple Are</a> and coming up with new projects and ways of promoting my current ones. I actually started this new project about a week ago, <a href="http://www.mymacdesk.com/" target="_blank">My Mac Desk</a>. So what is it?

Well, I've been seeing a lot of threads on Mac forums where users post images of their Mac setups and desktops, so I decided to make a site dedicated to this. I love Mac photos so it was an excellent project for me. But it wasn't at all as easy as it sounded.

At least not in the beginning. I had a hard time finding a multi-user gallery solution and almost though of paying for one before I found Coppermine. I had heard of it before but didn't really know what it was capable of. Anyhow, it worked great for the purpose of My Mac Desk.

So, I set it up but I needed it to look like Apple Are because the two are related. Tough job, took me some time but I got it done by using the K2 theme and kind of merging the CSS from Apple Are into it. Sounds easy but it wasn't, I ensure you. I'm pretty pleased with the results though.

My second Apple fan site was done. I've not had time to promote the site yet; it had up to 600 visitors a day for a few days but now it's stable at 50+. I was pretty pleased to see that it's ranking #3 in Google for "mac desk", considering how little time I've spent on promotion.

This is supposed to be a fun project, kind of a supplement to Apple Are at the moment. If you want, please <a href="http://www.mymacdesk.com/" target="_blank">add some photos of your mac desktop</a>; it's always fun too see. You do own a Mac, don't you?
