Hello there, readers. I've been keeping myself busy with a lot of different stuff this week. Let me give you a brief status report to keep you on track.

I've done some thinking about goals and how to achieve them. You have to buy yourself passive income, that's a fact. And to buy web estate that brings passive income, you need money. Money is most quickly earned by active work, so that's what I'm going to do.

So I bought myself a proxy hosting account and started making proxy sites. I've made four of them already and have been promoting all of them. The goal is not to achieve passive income with these proxies, the goal is to turn them profitable and sell them, and then invest the money into building more proxies. When I've earned enough money, I'll invest into long-term projects that'll bring passive income.

What I'm doing is using short-term work to achieve long-term goals. At the same time, I'm learning how to effectively promote websites, specifically proxies. But that's not all I'm doing, of course. I'm always looking out for potential baby projects to buy and promote, while also taking care of my main project, <a href="http://www.appleare.com" title="Apple Fan Blog" target="_blank">The Apple Fan Blog</a>.

Stay tuned for more progress reports.
