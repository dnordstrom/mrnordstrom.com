<p>A few weeks ago I had a presentation in front of a group of students at <a href="http://www.inholland.nl/">InHolland</a> in Amsterdam, talking about how they and anyone else can make their projects work smoother by using a good web based collaboration software.</p>

<p>In this case the software is Basecamp&rsquo;I'm not affiliated with the company behind it, I just like the software. However, since we ran a bit late, I recreated the presentation at home in my office when I had the time. You can download or stream the result here.</p>
<p>This is also the first episode of my new podcast, Confessions of a Web Junkie, which I'm planning to kick-start in June with <a href="http://30daysofcreativity.com/">#30DaysOfCreativity</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%2330daysofcreativity">Twitter</a>).
