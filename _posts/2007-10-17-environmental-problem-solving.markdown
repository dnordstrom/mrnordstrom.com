The <a href="http://www.blogactionday.com/" target="_blank">blog action day</a> is a day when bloggers from all around the world write about the same subject -- environment. This is supposed to change the world through mass participation; I like the idea. While I didn't blog on the official blog action day, it's still 15th-ish, isn't it?

Anyhow, the subject is environment. Not only is it a broad subject but it's also a subject I know almost nothing about. Neither do I want to know so much more about it because I find that environmental issues isn't something I want to tackle. At least not for the time being.

Since I've got the entrepreneurial drive in me, I will definitely stand face to face with environmental decisions sooner or later. Virtually all businesses have environmental issues they have to deal with. They all need to balance cost versus moral obligations when choosing everything from paper and plastic bags to material for computer cases.

While governments create and operate the systems, the world is largely run by private enterprise. Private companies are, for the most part, the ones providing the products and services that make the world go round. These companies are responsible for their actions and the consequences those actions have on the environment.

Of course, you say. So why am I mentioning this? Because many companies don't acknowledge their responsibility. And most of the ones that do, they do it for profit instead of ethics. There's something called "green marketing" that is becoming almost synonymous with bullshit these days, as many business executives manage based on the publics -- not their own company's -- interest in environmental issues.

This is something that is very hard to measure. There are companies out there that truly care about the environment but it's hard to tell who they are. Companies need to have clearly stated ethical policies and moral obligations. They need to communicate their own vision of their responsibility to the public so that there are no misunderstandings. And they need to tell it as it is -- not as the public want to hear it.

Of course, they'll also need to follow through with their plans and policies. But the first step is to communicate them and a lot of businesses, especially small businesses, fail to do this. And if the public can't tell what these businesses are doing for the environment, then how are they supposed to make consumer decisions that support these issues? Businesses need to understand the importance of communicating this part of their image.

Even if the private enterprise controls most of the world, the governments are still extremely powerful entities. As Peter Parker, Spiderman himself says; with great power comes great responsibility. The governments, especially in rich industrial countries need to step out of their little boxes and take action.

Politicians work out rules and regulations, and they financially support non-profit organizations. What I especially like is how they in some countries broadcast TV advertisements. That's the germ of outside-the-box thinking. What I'd like to see is more persuasive and innovative public service advertisements.

There are advertisement agencies out there that are extremely good at what they do. Make no mistake, they persuade people for a living. One way or another, I'm confident that governments can afford hiring one of these agencies. Top advertising agencies can deliver messages in very persuasive ways that give long lasting impressions. It's needed, because rules and regulations alone won't enlighten people or change their minds.

So that's a couple of things on top of my mind to help tackle the environmental issues. What I'd also like to discuss is the attitude with which people are facing them. The way most people go about it is, they fight global warming, they fight pollution, etc. It's good that these people actually do something about it but they do it the wrong way.

It's just not positive thinking. Fighting or starting a war against something should be a last resort. People should be promoting change in other, more positive ways. Instead of fighting pollution, promote the use of hybrid cars and further development of public transportation. Instead of a war against nuclear power, promote other ways of generating electricity.

Whatever you do, for gods sake don't call it a war or a fight. These are words that will send negative vibes to everyone around you. We don't want to hear about wars -- it's not healthy. Instead, I suggest you both think and speak in positive terms. It's a much more effective way of communication, as it will spread positivity and make life better for everyone around you.

You may not believe me and I understand you, I really do. Positive thinking is a hard subject to grasp because we're dealing with intangible forces. But imagine a world where no one mentioned the word "war".

Wouldn't that be a much nicer place?
