The Secret is a very good way of describing something incredibly abstract and complex. You can't really categorize the concept - is it philosophy, psychology or physics? That is, however, not important. What is important is how much sense it sometimes makes and how relevant I find it in my current situation.

<img class="alignright" style="margin-right: 15px; float: right;" title="hearts_2.jpg" src="http://www.mrnordstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/random/hearts_2.jpg" border="1" alt="hearts_2.jpg" width="213" height="161" />For those of you who are not familiar with The Secret, it can be described as the law of attraction. Everything you have, you have attracted. Everything you think, you are attracting. Everything you want, you can have. It might sound strange and you might be in doubt - I don't blame you.

Consider this, though.

I recently met a woman that I became more and more attracted to. The more I saw her and the more I talked to her, the more I liked her. She was, however, not interested in a relationship and I began to reject my feelings.

It didn't make sense. It wasn't me. What I decided to do was to accept my thoughts. This amazing person was in my life and I had the privilege to hang out with her. I thought about her - always and everywhere - and I embraced it. I loved it.

Every night as I went to sleep, there was a smile on my face because I had a more amazing friend than I could ever ask for. What happened next is what can only be described as the law of attraction.

The more I thought of her, the closer we became - and it went fast. Neither one of us can understand what happened. It didn't say click, it wasn't love at first sight. It was the law of attraction and I am now as happy as I am confused.

My point is - The Secret works. It's hard to understand and grasp before you've experienced it, but it works.

And what will happen is the Universe will correspond to the nature of your song. The Universe will correspond to the nature of that inner feeling, and manifest it, because that's the way you feel."</em>
