They needed a brief, personal and seemingly individual sales letter in Swedish and English, for sending to consumers and businesses that already have a website but could use a more visually appealing such.

It soon became clear to me that one letter wouldn't be satisfactory. Businesses and consumers have different needs and priorities so I decided to write a separate letter for each. The business letter would be more effective as aggressive and straight-forward while the consumer letter should naturally do a better job as personal and friendly.

<!--more-->I started working on the English versions first because I, for some reason, find it more enjoyable to write in English than in my native language. As I wrote the business letter, I put my effort into demonstrating to the reader the rational reasons for redesigning their website, since business owners logically respond (or at least <em>should</em> respond) better to rational than emotional appeal.

After translating the letter to Swedish I began writing another one, aimed at consumers. Since consumers tend to make a lot of decisions based on emotional reasoning, I could have based this letter on emotional appeal. Two reasons made me choose differently.

First of all, these are people that already own a website which means that they need a good reason for redesigning it. Of course, that reason could be an emotional reason but then there is also a slight problem in writing a personal, friendly and seemingly individual sales letter that utilizes emotional appeal. In this case, I believe that providing the reader with rational reasons would leave the client with more credability.

I was happy to see that the client was very pleased with both the result and my choice to go with separate letters. But I have to say, translating to Swedish was harder than I thought. I learned that it takes some time to find the right words and sometimes I had to adjust the sentence slightly to get the right impact on the reader.

All in all, it was a fun and interesting job. And that's what matters, because you will never become truly great at something you don't enjoy doing!

Thanks to Wagenius Designs for the opportunity.
