It????????s nice but not as nice as the one I had yesterday. I rarely put sugar in these as I like to keep a healthy appearance. It would be a disrespectful act towards both myself and the people close to me. My girlfriend is worthy of having a good looking man licking her nipples later this evening.

Things change. In front of me now is a glass of fine Merlot. Very tasty, indeed. This place has a nice feeling to it, with its leather couches, soft light and lit candles. Does it taste as good as it looks? Absolutely.

The wine gets my mind going. How come I indulge in these wonderful activities now, when I never have before? Is this a temporary act of insanity or is it simply the process of me becoming me? All I can tell you is that it feels good. It feels like <em>me</em>.

As a part of this new direction I????????m heading, I thought I????????d also clean up the blog and perhaps breathe some new life into it. I????????d like to make it more me. As my life is becoming increasingly interesting to me, maybe my blog will become more interesting to <em>you</em>.

The funny thing is, I????????m still trying to figure out what this blog is really about. Does a blog really need a niche? I would say it depends on who you????????re blogging for. Right now, I????????d like to use this blog to blog for myself. Though ultimately, I hope to blog for you, my dear readers.

For now, let????????s just make this blog about me and hope for the best.

Danny Nordstrom.
