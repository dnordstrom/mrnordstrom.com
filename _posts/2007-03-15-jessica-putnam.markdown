Yesterday, I was once again surprised by a photo shoot at my gym in Santa Monica. Lightning equipment occupied an entire corner of the facility and this time there was a few more people watching as the photographer did his job.

<img width="250" height="264" border="0" align="right" alt="jessica_and_me.jpg" title="jessica_and_me.jpg" style="border: 1px solid #000000; margin-left: 4px" src="http://www.mrnordstrom.com/wp-content/uploads/jessica_and_me.jpg" />In the cameras cross-hair was a woman with a physique that immediately told me she had to be a pro. Her body had such a stunningly balanced symmetry and her charisma made her glow like a true star.

The woman was Jessica Putnam, an IFBB professional, personal trainer and fitness model. She earned her pro status in 2005 and has been in a lot of competitions and magazines.

As we were approaching the end of our work-out, I was trying to figure out how I would gather the courage to actually speak to her and ask for a photo. It turned out to be surprisingly easy.

Introducing herself, she gave an amazing first impression. It was a very brief talk we had that day, but I can honestly say that I cannot recall the last time someone was that nice to me. Being nice is a rare quality these days, but she truly was.

Once again, I received proof that the fitness industry is filled with fantastic people and I hope to some day have a lot of great friends there.

Meeting with the players of this sport and watching them in the real world instead of the front cover of a magazine, even if the conversations are very brief, is a truly amazing experience for me and it gives me a lot of inspiration and motivation.

Thank you, Jessica!
