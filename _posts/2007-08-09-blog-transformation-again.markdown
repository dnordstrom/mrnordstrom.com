I just wanted to let you know that the blog is changing subject, direction, niche or whatever you call it. Yes, again. I think it's the third time now. We've gone from personal all-round blog (featuring training journal) to advertisement blog and now...

Internet business blog, as you might have noticed in the new header. Why?

Well, I've been creating websites for a very long time now, mostly because I enjoyed coding them. I've practically lived on the internet since I turned twelve and heard about a thing called HTML. One thing lead to another and lately I've started creating, buying, optimizing, promoting and selling websites.

Which I really enjoy, and that's why I'm turning the blog towards that niche from now on. Don't get me wrong, I love advertising. But I'm also an entrepreneur by heart, born and raised to work for myself. So when you combine creativity, business and the internet, what do you get?

I call it eEntrepreneurship and I hope you'll enjoy reading about it. Feel free to subscribe if you'd like.
