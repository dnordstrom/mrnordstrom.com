**This `master` branch** simply holds the writings fetched and displayed on [mrnordstrom.com](http://mrnordstrom.com).

**The `gh-pages` branch** hosts the actual site, powered by [Polestar](https://github.com/dnordstrom/polestar)&mdash;a tiny (600 lines complete with JSDoc comments, or 7 kB minified) and fully client-side content platform that renders Markdown formatted writings fetched from GitHub, and local partials.
