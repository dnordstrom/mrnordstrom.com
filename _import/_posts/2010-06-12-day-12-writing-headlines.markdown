<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been getting into this great habit of writing headlines. That&rsquo;s right&mdash;just headlines, nothing else. Of course, I also write one article per day for my blog this month as well but the headlines help a lot.</p>

<p><em>This is post 12/30 of <a href="http://30daysofcreativity.com/">#30daysofcreativity</a>.</em></p>
<p>You see, I read this article a couple of weeks ago on FreelanceFolder, titled <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/7-cant-miss-ways-to-kick-start-the-writing-habit/">&ldquo;7 Ways To Kick-Start Your Blogging Habit&rdquo;</a> (great post, read it). We all love these list posts, they&rsquo;re highly addictive, and this particular one is actually pretty relevant to my <a href="http://30daysofcreativity.com">#30daysofcreativity</a> challenge of writing every day.</p>
<h2>The method</h2>
<p>What the article says is that it&rsquo;s can be a good idea to sit down for a half-hour or so and just write headlines. Anything that comes to mind will do and they don&rsquo;t have to be all catchy. Just write headlines.</p>
<p>The thing is, you&rsquo;re not always in a productive enough mood to write an entire article&mdash;at least not a very good one&mdash;but if you pump out a bunch of headlines, you&rsquo;ll have a lot of subjects to choose from when you&rsquo;re in your more productive mood.</p>
<h2>My Way</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve adapted my own version of this method that in my opinion is a lot more time-efficient. It just doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to me to sit down and write anything at all if I&rsquo;m not in the mood for it. It makes sense to spend that time doing what I actually feel like doing, whatever that may be.</p>
<p>So I have a &ldquo;project&rdquo; in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">GTD</a> application <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> which is called &ldquo;Headlines&rdquo;. For those not familiar with the GTD concept, a project is basically a list of actions or ideas. This &ldquo;Headlines&rdquo; project is located in my &ldquo;Someday/Maybe&rdquo; project folder since, well, I may be using them someday.</p>
<p>Whenever I come across something interesting that I&rsquo;d like to write about sometime, I simply stick it into my &ldquo;Headlines&rdquo; project with a reference URL or some other information I can use to remember my chain of thought. It takes a few seconds to gather this information and then I can go back to what I was doing.</p>
<p>Once I decide to sit down to write an article or two, I just look at my list of headlines. There&rsquo;s never a need to come up with a subject to write about, and that saves a whole lot of time. Imagine just sitting down, picking a subject and start writing right away. That&rsquo;s what I do.</p>
<p>The reason why this works out particularly well for me is that I read a lot of blogs, tweets and forum threads every day and I often come across interesting subjects which give me spontaneous ideas about things I could write, or sometimes feel like I need to write. Having a system for gathering and processing those ideas is invaluable.</p>
<h2>Doing It Yourself</h2>
<p>While I highly suggest you do use a GTD system since it&rsquo;s designed for gathering and processing information, it&rsquo;s not at all necessary. You can use post-its, Google Docs, a notebook&mdash;whatever works for you.</p>
<p>Finally, just make sure you think it through. What about when you&rsquo;re out of the office or away from home? You can still get ideas once in a while. OmniFocus which I use is available for both iPhone and Mac OS, which means I either have it in front of me or in my pocket wherever I am.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit expensive though but there are a lot of options you can use. Things is one, ActionMethod is another, Google Docs a third, iCal todo a fourth, and so on. Last but definitely not least, a pocket-sized Moleskine notebook is a recommended traditional method that has proven to work very well.</p>
