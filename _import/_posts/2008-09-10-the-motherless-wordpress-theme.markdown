<p>After much hesitation and consideration, I took the open source community's advice - "release early, release often" - and finally put this WordPress theme up for download. Let me tell you a little about it.</p>

<p>To begin with, it's an early release (and my first WP theme!). Beta, alpha, call it what you want. It's working on my site and has been tested in a lot of browsers. However, there are no guarantees. Now what about the good stuff?</p>

<p>The vision (yeah, I have those) is that you shouldn't have to edit a single line of PHP, CSS or (X)HTML except for a config file. In other words, it's meant to be very easily customizable. It's far from there yet but it's actually fairly simple.</p>

<p>You can create substyles - change the color scheme - and just change CSS filepath in index.php. I've created a default style in styles/substyles/default which you can easily copy or make changes to.</p>

<p>Right now, the config file is very small and basically only gives you the option to change column widths. This file is something I'll be working on expanding when I have the time, and hopefully it'll later be used to specify style and widths as well as turn many features on or off.</p>

<p>A few momentary catches: it lacks widget support and you'll need a few plugins for it to work without modifications. Oh, and there's no documentation. But this is all on my todo list, as well as some layout- and bug fixes.</p>
