<p>Writing HTML for e-mail clients is a daunting task â€“ horrible even. I don't know if you agree but that's my opinion after doing so for a couple of days now. However, one thing that can make your life a whole lot easier is this little app.</p>

<p>The first thing I asked myself before starting to develop my template was; how will I test this? Well, <a href="http://www.litmusapp.com/">Litmus App</a> is a web application that lets you check your website, e-mail or newsletter HTML across 16 major e-mail clients and 23 different web browsers. The question is; does it work?</p>

<p>It works beautifully and honestly â€“ it's absolutely brilliant. You select which clients and browsers you want to test your template against and it magically generates screenshots of all of them. It takes a few minutes to run all the test of course, but it's nothing compared to manually checking your code.</p> 

<p>It also has this really snappy and simple AJAX interface that I absolutely love. There was some minor trouble with their Apple Mail 2 client during my tests but the fact that they accurately report their system status real time is good enough for me to forgive them.</p>

<p>You're probably starting to wonder if I'm one of their sales reps by now but it's just a really nice app that saved me a lot of time. It costs a few dollars ($24/day or $49/month) and it's a very small price to pay for what you get.</p>

<p>Recommended â€“ one of my favorite web apps.</p>
