<p><em>(How many people can type that without mistyping it "Googles" the first time?)</em></p>

<p>Last week I wrote about passion and itâ€™s importance for entrepreneurial success. Someone wrote a great comment about inspiration and how it affects passion. My belief is that inspiration can be seen as a trigger, or perhaps a stimulant, to passion. You could even see it as a tool for finding what you love and keeping it alive.</p>

<p>Inspiration keeps us going. It reminds us of what we love, or our pursuit for love. It shows us the beauty of something we may do every day and love more than anything but still take for granted. If we really want something, inspiration keeps us in the direction of getting it.</p>

<p>Many people, including myself, find it hard to take the time to get inspired. The inspiration is there, we just donâ€™t take it all in. Truth be told, we have ourselves to blame. Getting inspired is often an effortless endeavor. Read a book for 5 minutes and youâ€™re inspired. Do a Google search for something you enjoy. Indulge in the endless resources that are at your disposal, immediately, every day.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a few things that get me inspired.

<p><strong>Buy books</strong>
Even though you donâ€™t have the time to read them right now, buy them anyway. If you admire someone, buy their biography. Just having the books on your desk or bookshelf will inspire you.</p>

<p><strong>Buy magazines</strong>
Thereâ€™s at least one for you out there. Personally, I live in Amsterdam and can still find English magazines such as Computer Arts and Practical Web Design. Itâ€™s a small price to pay for the inspiration you get.</p>

<p><strong>Read blogs</strong>
Hunt for blogs on the subject you love and subjects related to it. Canâ€™t find one? Let me know and Iâ€™ll help you. Itâ€™s perhaps the easiest way to get inspired if you work in an office with internet access. Not to mention the conversations you can have through the comment box.</p>

<p><strong>Talk relentlessly</strong> 
Talk relentlessly about your passion any chance you get. This is most effective with like-minded people but if your apprentice of the moment finds the subject uninteresting, thatâ€™s okay too. He may very well be inspired by your passion alone.</p>

<p><strong>Start a blog</strong>
Youâ€™ll be surprised at how you can kick start your motivation and passion just by writing about what you do or want to do. Skip Blogger and go custom, itâ€™s much more rewarding. Donâ€™t know how or think you canâ€™t afford it? Let me know and Iâ€™ll make it happen.</p>

<p><strong>Notice your kind of details</strong>
Negative or positive doesnâ€™t matter. Wherever you are, take a look at the details. If you are into design, notice the design or everything that surrounds you. If you are into recruitment, notice every person around you. Sooner or later, youâ€™ll see what kind of difference you want to make in the world.</p>

<p>What works for me doesn't automagically work for you but sometimes it's just a matter of opening our eyes.</p>
