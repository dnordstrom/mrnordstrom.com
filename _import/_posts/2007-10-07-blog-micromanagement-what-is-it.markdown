Management is about directing and using resources to achieve your goals. In blogging, this may mean using your writing skills and knowledge to increase your number of readers, while also learning more about your niche and the blogging industry. To do this, you have to be able to see the big picture and act accordingly. But there's another aspect of blogging that I'd like to call blog micromanagement.

Blog micromanagement is all about paying attention to the details, and going deeper. You're focusing on the very same things but on a smaller scale. You're still focusing on content, on how and what you write. But instead of focusing your attention on the subject you write about and what direction you're tackling it, you'll focus on how you compile your sentences and paragraphs, and what words you're using.

Such micromanagement is necessary to properly project your image to your readers. After you've seen the big picture and defined your blogging personality, you need to communicate it to your readers in a unified way. Every aspect of your blog needs to reflect the big picture; your identity. Every small detail of your blog sends a message, and blog micromanagement is about making sure that the message backs up your image.

Once you have defined your image and the message you want to communicate, you'll have to keep them in mind at all times. When you choose a theme, when you write, when you comment, when you promote; always keep your image and identity in mind. If you do, you will create your own big picture. Your image, or perhaps we should call it brand, will be strong and your readers will see a blog high in self-esteem. They will see a blog that is standing tall and secure.

I personally own an <a href="http://www.appleare.com" target="_blank">Apple blog</a>. Let's say I wrote a post today saying I was the greatest Microsoft hater on the internet and that Microsoft and of their products should be banned by law. Next week, I write a post about Microsoft's Office 2008 for Mac, saying that it's the best Office suit I've ever used. What happens is, I'll have a lot of confused readers who no longer believes in me because my opinions are fluctuating. We have to make up our minds and stick to our opinions. That is, as long as we're not basing or writings on <a href="http://j-amusement.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">occasional u-turns</a>.

However, there's more to blog micromanagement than strengthening your image. As I said, management is about supporting your goals; micromanagement just does it on a smaller scale. It's about the little things that can increase your subscriber count and readership slightly. Even if it's just a few small percents, it's optimal.

That's what micromanagement is: an optimality obsession.
