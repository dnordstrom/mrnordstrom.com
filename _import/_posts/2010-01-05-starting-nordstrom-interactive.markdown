<p>I planned this a long time ago but is like they say; better late than never. A few weeks ago, I sent an announcement to my friends an family to uncover the mysteries regarding my employment situation. I'm happy to say that I've finally started my own business. This announcement is the first post of the year and welcomes a new decennium.</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote>
<p>Dear friends (including clients) and family,</p>

<p>I have an announcement to make so that we finally clear things up and everyone is properly informed. Like most of you already know, I have resigned from my position as Head of Production at MARS media. From now on, I am no longer working for MARS media or the Yaiks group.</p>

<p>Getting to know everyone and working alongside so many bright people has been a pleasure. Iâ€™d like to thank the Yaiks group for giving me the opportunity to come to the Netherlands and work with what I love. Also, I want to thank MARS media for allowing me the freedom to explore my passion and further develop my experience and talent.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>To explain briefly what Iâ€™ll be doing now, I have two registered businesses which I own and operate full-time. The primary business is my interactive agency Nordstrom Interactive (a.k.a. Nintera) where my title, if I had one, would be director and web producer. Nintera will occasionally work in collaboration with MARS media on projects where I will be doing the production.</p>

<p>Nintera provides production and consultation for web projects, and technical representation (of e.g. online presence) andÂ technology managementÂ for businesses and people. The long-term target audience is inspiring people within the creative industryâ€”working with artists and big-time interactive and advertising agencies.</p>

<p>An important part of the business concept is to develop long-term informal (yet professional) relationships with clients, being able to call each other friends. Some people find this negativeâ€”I donâ€™t. The goal is to be honest and discuss with the client to together come up with the most cost-effective solution, and keep everyone smiling. This industry is known for it's over-promising and oversellingâ€”dreadful activities which my businesses will never support.</p>

<p>This all seem to work out very well so far and Iâ€™m looking forward to lead a team of talented people within three years time. If you would like to know more about my business activities or concepts, please drop by or just send me an email and I will answer your questions. I'm delighted to find that every single one of my clients so far are wonderful people that are great to deal with.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I offer a 10% commission to anyone who refers me work. If you know someone who is in need of consultation or web production of any kind, please refer them to me and youâ€™ll receive 10% of the first project fee if it goes through.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been planning to start my own business for six years so this is a great experience. Iâ€™m learning every day and developing my knowledge and personality faster than ever. Itâ€™s certainly not for everyone but I believe it runs it the family and everyone who knows me also knows that I work best when Iâ€™m in complete control and can be as pedantic and professional as my perfectionism tells me to be. I have my father to thank for preparing me for this throughout my childhood byÂ raising me as an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>[...] It is business as usual except for the fact that Iâ€™m working independently. I will also try to help people more often through articles and various discussion boards.</p>

<p>Again, it was (and is, for those of you I'm currently working with) a great pleasure working with you all.</p>

<p>I wish you a very happy holiday!</p>
