Yesterday, Erik and I was walking down Wilshire Blvd on our way to Albertsons, looking for a place to grab some food at before shopping since it was 3 PM and we had yet to eat breakfast. After walking around for half an hour, we found the perfect place, California Wok.

Wok was perfect. Healthy, farily priced and delicious. We didn't know the place but we went in and sat down, and in a matter of seconds a guy comes to our table and hands us the menu, plus water and a can of tea. A minute later, in comes soup and salad which was a pleasant surprise because we were insanely hungry.

The soup was delicious and so were the salad. We were in fact very surprised and impressed. After ejoying the soup, we look at the menu and decided to go with the Chicken Chao Fun.

Minutes later, in comes a man carrying the two most filled plates I have ever seen, literally. The amounts of food we got was stunning and so was the taste. A truly perfect meal of chinese food was what we stumbled upon that day. And for those who wonder, we ate it all!

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

Great service, they even refilled our glasses with water three times. Awesome taste and enough food to kill a horse. Also, great prices. We got salad, tea, and a whole lot of food for just above 8 dollars.

5/5 - Insanely great!
