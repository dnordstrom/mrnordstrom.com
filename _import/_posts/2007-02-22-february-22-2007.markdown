I haven't been writing for a while and that's because I have had some trouble finding a suitable gym over here in Santa Monica. I was supposed to live in Marina Del Rey and work out at the original World Gym, but things got really messed up and I ended up looking for apartments. Finally, I settled at Chelsea Avenue/Wilshire.

Two weeks went by without training as I was looking for gyms located within biking distance from my apartment. Then I found it, the light in the dark on this long road towards perfect symmetry.

My new gym contains the best equipment available, world class stuff. I'm talking Hammer Strength, Iron Grip and so forth. It is the most awesome facility I have ever worked out in. Their water is ultra-filtrated. Their staff is awesome. Their music is hand-picked.

It is a little expensive with it's $70/month, but I guess it's worth it, along with the 10 minute bike ride to get there. After all, I did sit on a bus for an hour a day, five days a week, to get to my gym in Sweden.

For the next three months, you can find me at Active Fitness in Santa Monica, lifting heavy ass weight three times a week. I'm back in business, people.
