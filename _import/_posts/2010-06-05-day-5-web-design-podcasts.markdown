<p>Podcasts are fantastic sources of inspiration and I highly recommend spending some time each day on a few of them. An important value of my company&mdash;and hopefully yours as well&mdash;is to learn something new every day. Here are a few of my favorite podcasts, both audio and video.</p>

<p><em>This is day five of <a href="http://30daysofcreativity.com">#30daysofcreativity</a>.</em></p>
<p><h2>NETTUTS</h2><br>Video - <a href="http://nettuts.blip.tv/rss/itunes">link</a></p>
<p>Wonderful video podcast tutorials on everything from ASP.NET to WordPress for Designers. To name a few; CodeIgniter from Scratch 1&ndash;10, Build Kick-Ass CSS3 Buttons, How to Make All Browsers Render HTML5 Mark-up Correctly and many others.</p>
<p><h2>Boagworld Web Design Advice</h2><br>Audio - <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/boagworldpodcast">link</a></p>
<p><a href="http://boagworld.com/">Paul Boag</a>, or <a href="http://twitter.com/boagworld">@boagworld</a>, frequently and repeatedly provides excellent web design advice in this audio podcast. A few days ago, podcast number 213 was released so there&rsquo;s a whole lot of information to go through. Subjects include Are Clients Stupid?, More Skills To Learn, HTML5, Get More From Google Analytics and so on.</p>
<p><h2>Photoshop User TV</h2><br>Video - <a href="http://kelbytv.com/photoshopusertv/podcast/">link</a></p>
<p>The charismatic hosts of this video podcast will provide you with a weekly Photoshop and Adobe news, tutorials and tricks. Even if you&rsquo;re not a graphic designer, this show will entertain and teach you valuable lessons. Past show descriptions; New Features in Photoshop CS5, Favorite Keyboard Shortcuts, Popular Bronze Toning Effect etc.</p>
<p><h2>SitePoint Podcast</h2><br>Audio - <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/?feed=podcast">link</a></p>
<p>SitePoint Forums and Blogs are two places I visit pretty much daily. After some time, I discovered that SitePoint also offer a great podcast so of course I had to subscribe. It features a lot of nice subjects as well as interviews with people such as Mat Patterson from Campaign Monitor and Derek Powazek, co-creator of JPG Magazine.</p>
<p><h2>Web Design TV</h2><br>Video - <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/pwd">link</a></p>
<p>This is a video podcast from the makers of .net magazine, the one magazine I actually read sometimes. Like the magazine, this podcast features interviews with digital experts, Adobe software technique and a lot moreâ€”for example Flash Catalyst CS5 (for interaction design), Meeting Otterball (Jason Jones) and Getting Ahead In A Recession.</p>
<p><h2>Worth mentioning</h2></p>
<p>There are a few others I&rsquo;d like to mention as well. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/web20Show">The Web 2.0 Show</a> is what got me started listening to podcasts a couple of years agoâ€”great show. Two non-web related podcasts I have a look at once in a while are the <a href="http://www.apple.com/podcasts/apple_keynotes/apple_keynotes.xml">Apple Keynotes</a> podcast and the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/thebobdylanpodcast">Bob Dylan Podcast</a>. The latter one is a great story for anyone interested in the life of a great poet/musician/folk artist.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m up for more subscriptions so if you have any recommendation, please leave a comment below!</p>
