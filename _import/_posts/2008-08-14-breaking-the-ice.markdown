<p>I'm going home in, what is it? 5 minutes. Still I feel like I really need to break the ice here. It's been <em>weeks</em> since I wrote anything so what have I been up to all this time?</p>

<p>A lot's been going on at work of course but that's just stuff I'm getting used to now. It never ends - no matter how fast I work or how many hours a day, some project will always be waiting. And that's a good thing, really.</p>

<p>Nah, I could've been writing some more but I had to get this blog theme up and running first. I've been looking around for a couple of years now and I always get bored within a few weeks. Every time. So I decided to make my own instead.</p>

<p>What you see here is... I'll call it a beta version. Lots of stuff is missing but it works. Yyou can't really see it on the outside but the styling and color picking is very simple in this one and you can quickly create your own kind of color palette.</p>

<p>The plan is to get it up here for download as soon as it becomes a little more complete and stable. We'll see when that happens. At least now I can relax and perhaps start writing some more.</p>

<p>Time to go home, there's a long friday and weekend ahead. TPM at work tomorrow and then my girlfriend and I have to move out and maybe do a viewing. The hunt for a permanent apartment in Amsterdam continues.</p>
