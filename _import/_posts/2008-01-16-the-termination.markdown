We're obsessed with the development of information technology, we really are. We want computers to be smarter than computers. We want them to be more powerful than anything else.

But what happens when we create something that outsmarts us? What happens when we build something that can continue to build itself? When and how will it end?

Innovation and progress is something I truly believe in. And I really hate to use the <em>but</em> word here. Forward is really the only way to do. But...

<em>I don't want mankind to become a slave for it's own creation. </em>
