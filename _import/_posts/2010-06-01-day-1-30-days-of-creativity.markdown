<p>The <a href="http://30daysofcreativity.com/">30 Days Of Creativity</a> has officially begun. It&rsquo;s a period of one month when people from all around the world do something creative every day. A community has built up around the event and you can join by using the Twitter hash-tag <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%2330daysofcreativity">#30DaysOfCreativity</a>.</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve decided to do is to kick-start my blogging habit again by writing one post per day throughout this month about a subject that has caught my attention. There&rsquo;s always something interesting to come across during the day. I would also like to create one podcast episode every week as long as my schedule allows it.</p>
<p>Today the subject is #30DaysOfCreativity itself. I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic idea and I highly encourage anyone to take part. Sketch, design, write or build&mdash;whatever your thing is, join in by checking out the <a href="http://30daysofcreativity.com/">website</a> and start using the Twitter hash-tag. It&rsquo;s such a simple idea, yet so great and fun.</p>
<p>Looking forward to see some great creations during the coming 30 days!</p>
