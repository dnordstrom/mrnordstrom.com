<p>Only five days left on the #30daysofcreativity. Yesterday I introduced a <a href="http://www.mrnordstrom.com/2010/06/24/day-24-blogging-for-clients/">new side project</a> of mine and today I am introducing another, for all of you who cannot afford to travel around the globe to attend conferences.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="http://www.speechesarehot.com/">SpeechesAreHot.com</a> is a source of conference video clips on technology and entrepreneurship in the design and development industry. I found myself constantly looking for, and discovering, these videos using many different sources such as Twitter, blogs, YouTube and so on.</p>
<p>So I though, why not put all of them in the same place? Sounds logical, and I made quickly put together a website running on the Symfony PHP framework and registered the domain. We all enjoy great conference presentations so go check out <a href="http://www.speechesarehot.com/">SpeechesAreHot.com</a>&mdash;it will be available as soon as the DNS has been updated and the site has been deployed.</p>
<p>Feel free to email me recommendations!</p>
