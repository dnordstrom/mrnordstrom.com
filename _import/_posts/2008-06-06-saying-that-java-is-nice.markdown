Was reading through the toplist at Bash.org a few days ago. <em>Yeah,Â really busy at work these days.</em> Other than various sick, obscene and twisted stuff, there was a particular quote I remember.

"Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OS's is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders."

You can just feel how sick and tired this person is ofÂ asking the question <em>"Why the hell do you think Java is so good?"</em> and getting the answer "<em>Well, for starters it's cross-platform."</em>Â 

Java actuallyÂ is nice because it's soÂ insanely cross-platform but it's still pretty funny.Â While we're at it, there's also the obsession with object-oriented design which is also good. And! In theory it should be <em>kind of</em>Â fast because it's <em>kind of</em>Â compiled, right?

I don't have much, if any, experience with Java butÂ I feel that it's stable, complete, mature, has some fine syntax and promotes great design but sometimes feels a little bloated and slow. Then of course, it's <em>cross-platform!</em>
