<p>As a creator, you know it. You know that urge. We all do.</p>

<p>In your mind is a perfect picture of what you want. Yet, as you look around, nothing hits your smile button. Your mind sighs. It then utters those horrifying, familiar words, "but that shouldn't take long to create," and it's game over---you've just signed off on the brutal assassination of God knows how many days, weeks, or years of your life.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dnordstrom/polestar">Polestar</a> is a child of this beautiful process. It's the tiny Markdown site authoring and blogging tool in JavaScript now powering this site. It's GitHub flavored and fully client-side, with a simple purpose: to fetch Markdown from local files and a GitHub repository, parse it, and slap it onto a page.</p>

<p>It weighs in at about 7 kB minified, or around 680 lines fully commented and wrapped hard at 70 columns. The idea is to keep it tiny and modular (preferably no larger than 500 lines), and further develop the plugin mechanism.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, though, that a purely client-side solution has drawbacks. It's not search engine friendly and can't offer RSS feeds. However, a Polestar static site and feed generator is in development to scratch this itch.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is alpha software---it may not work, it will definitely change, and documentation is in the rough.</p>

<h2>
<a name="features--notes" class="anchor" href="#features--notes"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features &amp; Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Writings and Partials</strong><br>Writings are pulled from GitHub, partials from local files.</li>
<li>
<strong>Repository, Branch, and Directory</strong><br>Writings may be loaded from a specific branch and subdirectory.</li>
<li>
<strong>GitHub Flavored Markdown</strong><br>Markdown is parsed by the GitHub API.</li>
<li>
<strong>Autoload on Scroll</strong><br>Setting <code>loadAll: true</code> instead loads all writings on page load.</li>
<li>
<strong>Linking</strong><br>Writings are linkable using location hash, despite their dynamic loading. For instance, "example.com#the-filename" loads each writing until reaching "the-filename.md" (but only if it exists).</li>
<li>
<strong>Caching</strong><br>Writings are cached in sessionStorage to avoid unnecessary requests and GitHub API's dreaded rate limit.</li>
<li>
<strong>Previewing</strong><br>Preview a local, unpublished writing using the "draft" preference (<code>draft: 'writings/new-article'</code>). It won't be cached.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plugins</strong><br>These are objects with methods such as <code>beforeRender</code> or <code>afterAll</code> that are called with the Polestar instance as first argument. Writing-specific methods like <code>beforeRender</code> are also passed an object literal representation of the writing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Debug Mode and Parameters</strong><br>Set debug parameters with a location hashbang. Use the "debug" key to enable console output. While previewing, set GitHub credentials with "username" and "password" to increase the rate limit from 60 to 5000. For example: "http://localhost:8000#!username=me&amp;password=gosh&amp;debug"</li>
<li>
<strong>Plugins, Site, and Theme</strong><br>The markup, stylesheet, and plugins of this site are included as samples. For example, one plugin reverses "mailto" links to perhaps avoid some spam, and another adds the links you see as dates next to writings.</li>
</ul><p>Polestar has no dependencies, but requires a browser that supports things like <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>document.querySelector</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When previewing a local article, <strong>specify your GitHub credentials</strong> using debug parameters---or keep in mind GitHub's rate limit of 60 unauthenticated requests per hour. The API is used to parse your Markdown.</p>

<h2>
<a name="usage-by-example" class="anchor" href="#usage-by-example"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage by Example</h2>

<p>This site uses the following script tag to create a Polestar instance that appends my writings to the <code>&lt;section class="writings"&gt;</code> element:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-html"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
  <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Polestar</span><span class="p">({</span>
    <span class="nx">repo</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">'dnordstrom/mrnordstrom.com/writings'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">branch</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">'gh-pages'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">into</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">'.writings'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nx">plugins</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
      <span class="nx">Polestar</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Mailto</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">Polestar</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Permalinks</span><span class="p">,</span>
      <span class="nx">Polestar</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Typogr</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">})</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>It uses a partial for the header bit. This is just a matter of specifying the local Markdown file in the element's <code>data-at</code> attribute:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-html"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;header</span> <span class="na">data-at=</span><span class="s">"about"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"about"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="c">&lt;!-- Renders /about.md here --&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/header&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If this partial was residing instead in a subdirectory named "partials," we'd simply use <code>data-at="partials/about"</code>.</p>

<p><strong>To preview changes or writings locally</strong>, use any web server (just opening the HTML file won't allow Polestar to request content). For Mac users, or anyone with Python installed, the easiest way is to use Python's built-in server by running the following command from the site's directory:</p>

<pre><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="roadmap" class="anchor" href="#roadmap"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Roadmap</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Refactoring</strong><br>Refactor as much as possible into plugins to keep things modular and lightweight.</li>
<li>
<strong>Parser Preference</strong><br>Because GitHub API's Markdown parser strips away useful tags like <code>small</code>, <code>cite</code>, and <code>figure</code>, it should be possible to choose the parser, Markdown or otherwise (perhaps both), or to disable parsing altogether.</li>
<li>
<strong>YAML Front Matter Plugin</strong><br>Parsed data can be used as classes (<code>class="tag-one tag-two"</code>) or data-attributes (<code>data-tagone="value"</code>), giving more flexibility to plugins and styling.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pages Plugin</strong><br>This may simply be a plugin that adds functionality to open and close partials (with <code>data-page</code> attributes) as modal pages on top of other content.</li>
<li>
<strong>Error Handling</strong><br>Exceptions, pretty messages, console output, you name it---the real deal.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plugin Mechanism</strong><br>Make it smarter. Add methods as necessary---a drafts plugin could run <code>onReady</code>. Refactor to avoid <code>Function#call()</code>, and offer some interfacing with the Polestar instance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Local Version</strong><br>Create a smaller version of Polestar for rendering only local files, with no GitHub support. The example site will be a quick drop-in solution for rendering a README.md file.</li>
